// This conversion is partially viable. 
// The main limitation is that Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Python's inspect module, 
// which provides information about live objects such as modules, classes, objects, etc.
// However, we can achieve similar functionality using Rust's Reflection and std::any modules.

use std::any::Any;

fn process_tool_docs(item: &dyn Any) -> String {
    // Unfortunately, Rust does not have a direct way to get the documentation of a type.
    // However, we can use the std::any::type_name function to get the type name of the item.
    let item_type = std::any::type_name::<_>(&item);

    // To achieve similar functionality as Python's inspect.isclass, we can use Rust's std::any::TypeId.
    // However, it will not work exactly the same way because Rust is a statically typed language.
    let is_class = std::any::type_name::<_>(&item).contains("::");

    let metadata = if is_class {
        format!("Class Name: {}\n\n", item_type)
    } else {
        format!("Function Name: {}\n\n", item_type)
    };

    // Unfortunately, Rust does not have a direct way to get the source code of a type.
    // However, we can include a placeholder to denote the source code.
    let source_code = "Source Code: Not available in Rust";

    // To add documentation, we would need to manually write it as a string.
    // There's no straightforward way in Rust to get the documentation of a type at runtime.
    let documentation = "Documentation: Not available in Rust";

    metadata + &documentation + "\n\n" + source_code
}

fn main() {
    // Note: The example below is just for illustration purposes and won't compile as is.
    let item = 5i32;  // Example item
    println!("{}", process_tool_docs(&item));
}
```

**Feedback on Compatibility:**

*   **Dynamic Typing:** Rust is a statically typed language, which means it checks types at compile time, whereas Python is dynamically typed, checking types at runtime. This makes direct conversion challenging, especially when dealing with runtime type information like in the `inspect` module.
*   **Runtime Reflection:** The `inspect` module provides functionality that is similar to runtime reflection in Rust. However, Rust's Reflection capabilities are limited and can only be achieved using certain crates like `any` or `reflect`.
*   **Docstrings:** Python's docstrings are used to document functions and classes and can be accessed at runtime. In Rust, documentation is typically provided using comments that start with `///`, `///!`, or `//!`. It can be accessed using tools like `rustdoc`, but it is not directly accessible from the code.
*   **Function Signatures:** Rust's function signatures are more explicit than Python's. Function types, names, and argument types must be specified when defining a function in Rust.

**Conversion Limitations:**

*   **Source Code:** Rust does not provide direct access to the source code of a function or type at runtime.
*   **Documentation:** Rust's documentation is not directly accessible from the code like Python's docstrings.
*   **Type Inspection:** Rust's type inspection is limited compared to Python's `inspect` module.

**Rust Equivalent of Python's Inspect Module:**

Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `inspect` module. However, certain crates like `any`, `reflect`, or `serde_reflect` can be used to achieve similar functionality.

**portability:**

This Rust equivalent is portable and should work on all platforms that Rust supports. However, the behavior may vary slightly depending on the platform, especially when dealing with runtime type information.
