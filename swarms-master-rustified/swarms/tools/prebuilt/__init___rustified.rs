# Conversion Viability: Viable with limitations
# Reasoning: This Python file is simply importing and re-exporting functions and classes from other modules. The conversion to Rust is viable because Rust also supports importing and re-exporting modules and functions. However, the actual implementation of `math_eval` and `CodeExecutor` is not provided, so their conversion viability is uncertain.

Here's a possible Rust equivalent:

```rust
// Define a module to match the original Python file
// Since Rust is a compiled language, we need to know the exact library and function names used in the original code.
// For this example, let's assume `math_eval` and `CodeExecutor` are part of a custom library named `swarms`.

// Import the required libraries or modules
mod swarms {
    // Assume we have implemented or planned to implement the following modules in Rust
    pub mod math_eval;
    pub mod code_executor;
}

// Re-export the required functions or modules
pub use swarms::math_eval;
pub use swarms::code_executor::CodeExecutor;

// Note: This conversion assumes that the original `math_eval` and `CodeExecutor` have been implemented or will be implemented in Rust.
// The actual implementation details of these functions are not provided in the given Python file, so their conversion is uncertain.

// To avoid potential challenges in interoperation, make sure that any types and functions shared between Rust and Python code are correctly defined and implemented in both languages.
// If the rest of the repository uses the `swarms` library, ensure that its Rust implementation is compatible with the original Python implementation.

// Limitations and challenges:
// 1. The implementation details of `math_eval` and `CodeExecutor` are not provided, which can affect their conversion viability.
// 2. Compatibility with the rest of the repository depends on the implementation of the `swarms` library in Rust, ensuring it matches the Python implementation.
// 3. Interoperation between Rust and Python code may require additional work, such as using foreign function interfaces (FFI) or serialization libraries to share data between languages.
