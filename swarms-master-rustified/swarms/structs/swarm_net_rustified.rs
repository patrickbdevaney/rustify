**Conversion Feasibility:**
The conversion of this Python code to Rust is viable, but it will require significant changes due to differences in language syntax and ecosystem. The main challenges will be replacing Python libraries with their Rust equivalents, adapting to Rust's ownership system, and handling asynchronous programming.

**Conversion Risks and Limitations:**

1.  **Python libraries:** The code uses several Python libraries, such as `fastapi`, `pydantic`, `tenacity`, and `uvicorn`. These libraries will need to be replaced with their Rust equivalents, which may not provide identical functionality.
2.  **Asyncio:** Rust has a different approach to asynchronous programming. The `asyncio` library will need to be replaced with Rust's `async-std` or `tokio` libraries.
3.  **Threading:** Rust has a different threading model than Python. The `threading` library will need to be replaced with Rust's `std::thread` module or a threading library like `rayon`.
4.  **Ownership system:** Rust has a strict ownership system that can be challenging to adapt to, especially when working with complex data structures.

**Rust Equivalent:**
Here is a simplified version of the provided Python code converted to Rust. Note that this is not a direct translation, as Rust's syntax and ecosystem are different from Python's.

```rust
// Import necessary libraries
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use tokio::prelude::*;
use tokio::runtime::Builder;
use tokio::sync::oneshot;

// Define a struct to represent an agent
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Agent {
    id: String,
    agent_name: String,
    agent_description: String,
}

impl Agent {
    fn new(id: String, agent_name: String, agent_description: String) -> Self {
        Agent {
            id,
            agent_name,
            agent_description,
        }
    }
}

// Define a struct to represent the swarm network
#[derive(Debug)]
struct SwarmNetwork {
    name: String,
    description: String,

            agents,
            task_queue: Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new())),
        }
    }

    fn add_task(&self, task: String) {
        self.task_queue.lock().unwrap().push(task);
    }

    async fn async_add_task(&self, task: String) {
        let task_queue = self.task_queue.clone();
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            task_queue.lock().unwrap().push(task);
        });
    }

    fn run_single_agent(&self, agent_id: &str, task: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
        for agent in &self.agents {
            if agent.id == *agent_id {
                // Simulate running the task on the agent
                return Ok(format!("Task {} completed on agent {}", task, agent_id));
            }
        }
        Err(format!("Agent {} not found", agent_id))
    }

    fn run_many_agents(&self, task: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>, String> {
        let mut results = Vec::new();
        for agent in &self.agents {
            let result = self.run_single_agent(&agent.id, task);
            match result {
                Ok(result) => results.push(result),
                Err(err) => return Err(err),
            }
        }
        Ok(results)
    }
}

// Define a main function to test the swarm network
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let agent1 = Agent::new(
        "agent1".to_string(),
        "Covid-19-Chat".to_string(),
        "This agent provides information about COVID-19 symptoms.".to_string(),
    );

    let agents = vec![agent1];
    let swarm_name = "HealthSwarm".to_string();
    let swarm_description = "A swarm of agents providing health-related information.".to_string();

    let swarm = SwarmNetwork::new(swarm_name, swarm_description, agents);

    swarm.add_task("Task 1".to_string());
    swarm.add_task("Task 2".to_string());

    async_add_task(&swarm, "Task 3".to_string()).await;

    let result = swarm.run_single_agent("agent1", "Task 1");
    match result {
        Ok(result) => println!("{}", result),
        Err(err) => println!("{}", err),
    }

    let results = swarm.run_many_agents("Task 2");
    match results {
        Ok(results) => println!("{:?}", results),
        Err(err) => println!("{}", err),
    }
}
```

**Additional Advice:**

1.  **Learn Rust:** Before starting the conversion, make sure you have a good understanding of Rust's syntax, semantics, and ecosystem.
2.  **Use Rust libraries:** Instead of trying to find direct equivalents of Python libraries, explore Rust's ecosystem and use libraries that provide similar functionality.
3.  **Adapt to Rust's ownership system:** Rust's ownership system is designed to prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences. Take the time to understand how it works and how to use it effectively.
4.  **Use async/await:** Rust's `async-std` and `tokio` libraries provide a high-level interface for asynchronous programming. Use them to simplify your code and improve performance.
5.  **Test thoroughly:** Conversion can introduce bugs. Make sure to test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

By following these guidelines, you can successfully convert the provided Python code to Rust and take advantage of Rust's performance, reliability, and maintainability features.
