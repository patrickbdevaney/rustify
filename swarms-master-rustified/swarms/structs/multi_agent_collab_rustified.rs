// Conversion viability: Partially viable
// Reasoning: The provided Python code utilizes several custom libraries and classes, such as `Agent`, `BaseSwarm`, and `Conversation`, which are not part of the standard Python library. 
//             To ensure compatibility, these custom classes need to be rewritten in Rust. 
//             The given Python code also uses some methods that are not specified in the provided snippet, such as `ask_for_bid()`, `select_next_speaker()`, and `format_results()`. 
//             These missing methods should be implemented or their equivalent in Rust should be provided.

The given Python code has several custom classes and methods, which are not provided in the snippet. In the above Rust implementation, I've tried to recreate the equivalent structure and methods. However, you'll need to modify the code to fit your specific needs, especially where custom classes and methods are used.

**Limitations and Challenges:**

1.  **Custom Classes and Methods:** The Python code uses several custom classes and methods that are not defined in the provided snippet. These need to be implemented or replaced with their Rust equivalents.
2.  **Type Differences:** Python and Rust have different type systems. Rust is statically typed, which means it checks the types of variables at compile time. You may need to add type annotations for variables and function parameters in the Rust code.
3.  **Error Handling:** Rust has a strong focus on error handling, and you'll need to handle potential errors that may occur during file operations, JSON parsing, or other tasks.
4.  **Library Dependencies:** The Python code seems to use several external libraries, such as `swarms.structs.agent`, `swarms.utils.loguru_logger`, and `swarms.structs.base_swarm`. You'll need to find equivalent Rust libraries or implement the required functionality manually.

To overcome these challenges, you should:

*   Carefully review the Python code and identify the custom classes and methods that need to be implemented or replaced in Rust.
*   Research and choose suitable Rust libraries for tasks like logging, JSON parsing, or file operations.
*   Add type annotations and handle potential errors in the Rust code to ensure robustness and reliability.
*   Thoroughly test the Rust implementation to ensure it behaves as expected and produces the desired results.
