**Conversion Viability:**
The conversion of the provided Python file to Rust is viable, but it will require significant modifications due to differences in the languages and their ecosystems. The main challenges will be:

1.  **Async/Await Syntax:** Rust's async/await syntax is similar to Python's, but Rust requires explicit lifetime management and error handling.
2.  **Concurrency:** Rust provides strong concurrency support through libraries like Tokio and async-std, but the programming model is different from Python's asyncio.
3.  **Data Parallelism:** Rust's ownership model and borrowing system will require careful handling when working with parallel data processing.
4.  **Dynamic Dispatch:** Rust's type system is statically typed, which means that dynamic dispatch (e.g., using Python's ` typing.Callable`) will need to be replaced with Rust's trait system or other design patterns.

Here is a basic example of how the `run_single_agent` and `run_agents_concurrently` functions could be rewritten in Rust:

```rust
// Import necessary libraries
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::task;
use async_trait::async_trait;

// Define a trait for Agent
#[async_trait]
trait Agent {
    async fn run(&self, task: &str) -> String;
}

// Define a struct for Agent
struct MyAgent {
    name: String,
}

// Implement the Agent trait for MyAgent
#[async_trait]
impl Agent for MyAgent {
    async fn run(&self, task: &str) -> String {
        // Simulate agent execution
        format!("Agent {} executed task: {}", self.name, task)
    }
}

// Run a single agent
async fn run_single_agent(agent: &dyn Agent, task: &str) -> String {
    agent.run(task).await
}

// Run multiple agents concurrently
async fn run_agents_concurrently(agents: Vec<Arc<dyn Agent>>, task: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    let mut handles = Vec::new();

    // Create a task for each agent
    for agent in agents {
        let task_clone = task.clone();
        let agent_clone = agent.clone();
        handles.push(task::spawn(async move {
            run_single_agent(&*agent_clone, &task_clone).await
        }));
    }

    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    for handle in handles {
        let result = handle.await.unwrap();
        results.push(result);
    }

    results
}

// Example usage
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let agents: Vec<Arc<dyn Agent>> = (0..5)
        .map(|i| Arc::new(MyAgent {
            name: format!("Agent {}", i),
        }))
        .collect();

    let task = "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria";
    let outputs = run_agents_concurrently(agents, task).await;

    for (i, output) in outputs.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("Output from agent {}: {}", i + 1, output);
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to define an `Agent` trait, create a struct that implements this trait, and run multiple agents concurrently using Tokio's task API.

However, the original Python code uses many libraries and features that are not directly translatable to Rust, such as `asyncio`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `psutil`, and `dataclasses`. To complete the conversion, you would need to:

1.  **Replace `asyncio` with a Rust async runtime:** You can use Tokio or async-std, which provide similar async/await syntax and concurrency support.
2.  **Replace `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a Rust thread pool:** You can use the `rayon` crate for parallelism or the `tokio` crate for async concurrency.
3.  **Replace `psutil` with a Rust system metrics library:** You can use the `systemstat` crate for system metrics.
4.  **Replace `dataclasses` with Rust structs and derive macros:** You can use the `derive` macro from the `serde` crate to generate serialization and deserialization code for your structs.

**Note:** The above code is a simplified example and does not cover all the features of the original Python code. You will need to carefully examine the original code and adapt it to Rust's syntax and ecosystem.
