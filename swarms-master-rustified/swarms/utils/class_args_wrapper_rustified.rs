### Viability of Conversion
The conversion of the provided Python file to Rust is viable, but it has some limitations and challenges. Rust's type system and borrow checker require explicit type definitions and lifetime management, which can make the conversion more complex. However, Rust provides a `std::any::type_name` function that can be used to get the type name of a variable, similar to Python's `__init__` method inspection.

### Limitations and Challenges
1.  **Reflection:** Rust does not support runtime reflection like Python's `inspect` module. Instead, we will need to rely on compile-time reflection using Rust's macro system or explicit type definitions.
2.  **Type Annotations:** Rust's type annotations are compile-time checked and do not provide the same level of runtime type inspection as Python. We will need to rely on explicit type definitions or use a library like `serde` for serialization and deserialization.
3.  **Error Handling:** Rust's error handling is more explicit than Python's try-except block. We will need to use Rust's `Result` and `Error` types to handle errors.

### Rust Equivalent
```rust
// Conversion viability: Viable, but with limitations
// The conversion is viable, but it requires explicit type definitions and compile-time reflection.

use std::any::type_name;

// Define a trait for classes that can print their parameters
trait Printable {
    fn print_parameters(&self);
}

// Define a struct to hold parameter information
struct Parameter {
    name: String,
    type_name: String,
}

impl Parameter {
    fn new(name: String, type_name: String) -> Self {
        Self { name, type_name }
    }
}

// Define a macro to generate the print_parameters method for a struct
macro_rules! generate_print_parameters {
    ($struct_name:ident, $($param_name:ident: $param_type:ty),*) => {
        impl Printable for $struct_name {
            fn print_parameters(&self) {
                $(
                    println!("Parameter: {}, Type: {}", stringify!($param_name), type_name::<$param_type>());
                )*
            }
        }
    };
}

// Define a struct and generate the print_parameters method
struct ExampleStruct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

generate_print_parameters!(ExampleStruct, x: i32, y: i32);

fn main() {
    let example_struct = ExampleStruct { x: 1, y: 2 };
    example_struct.print_parameters();
}
```

### Explanation
1.  We define a `Printable` trait with a `print_parameters` method that can be implemented for structs.
2.  We define a `Parameter` struct to hold parameter information, including the name and type name.
3.  We define a `generate_print_parameters` macro that generates the `print_parameters` method for a struct based on its fields.
4.  We define an `ExampleStruct` and use the `generate_print_parameters` macro to generate the `print_parameters` method.
5.  In the `main` function, we create an instance of `ExampleStruct` and call its `print_parameters` method to print the parameters.

### Compatibility with the Rest of the Project
To ensure compatibility with the rest of the project, you should:
1.  Integrate the `Printable` trait and `Parameter` struct into your existing codebase.
2.  Use the `generate_print_parameters` macro to generate the `print_parameters` method for your structs.
3.  Modify your existing code to use the `print_parameters` method instead of relying on Python's `inspect` module.

By following these steps, you can convert the provided Python file to Rust and ensure compatibility with the rest of your project. However, keep in mind the limitations and challenges mentioned earlier, and be prepared to adapt your code to Rust's compile-time reflection and explicit type definitions.
