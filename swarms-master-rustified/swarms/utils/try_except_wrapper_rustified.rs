Here is a detailed explanation of the conversion:

1. **Decorators**: Rust does not have a direct equivalent for Python decorators. However, we can achieve similar functionality using traits and closures. In the provided Rust code, we define a `Retryable` trait that can be implemented for any closure that returns a `Result`. We also define a function `log_execution_time` that takes a closure and returns another closure that logs the execution time. Similarly, `try_except_wrapper` takes a closure and returns another closure that wraps the original closure with a try-except block.

2. **Logger**: The provided Python code uses a custom logger, but Rust's standard library does not come with a built-in logger. However, there are several logging crates available for Rust, such as `log` and `env_logger`. In the provided Rust code, we use the `env_logger` crate to initialize the logger.

3. **Error Handling**: Rust has a strong focus on error handling, and the provided Rust code uses the `Result` type to handle errors. The `divide` function returns a `Result` that is `Ok` if the division is successful and `Err` if the division is by zero. The `try_except_wrapper` function catches any errors that occur during the execution of the wrapped closure and logs an error message.

4. **Closures**: Rust's closures are similar to Python's lambda functions. In the provided Rust code, we define several closures that wrap the `divide` function with retry, logging, and try-except functionality.

5. **Traits**: Rust's traits are similar to Python's abstract base classes. In the provided Rust code, we define a `Retryable` trait that can be implemented for any closure that returns a `Result`.

**Risks and Limitations:**

1. **Error handling**: Rust's error handling is more explicit than Python's, and the provided Rust code uses the `Result` type to handle errors. However, the `try_except_wrapper` function catches any errors that occur during the execution of the wrapped closure and logs an error message. This may not be desirable in all situations, and additional error handling may be necessary.

2. **Logger**: The provided Rust code uses a custom logger, but Rust's standard library does not come with a built-in logger. The choice of logging crate and the initialization of the logger may need to be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the project.

3. **Performance**: The provided Rust code uses several closures and traits, which may have a performance impact. However, the performance impact should be minimal in most situations, and the code should be efficient enough for most use cases.

**Challenges:**

1. **Error handling**: Rust's error handling is more explicit than Python's, and the provided Rust code uses the `Result` type to handle errors. However, the `try_except_wrapper` function catches any errors that occur during the execution of the wrapped closure and logs an error message. This may require additional error handling to be implemented, depending on the specific requirements of the project.

2. **Logger**: The choice of logging crate and the initialization of the logger may need to be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the project.

3. **Traits and closures**: The provided Rust code uses several traits and closures, which may require additional learning and understanding to implement correctly. However, the code should be well-documented and easy to follow, and the use of traits and closures should be minimal and straightforward.
