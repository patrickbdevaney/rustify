**Conversion Viability:**
The conversion of the provided Python file to Rust is partially viable. While Rust provides libraries and APIs for most of the required operations (e.g., `tokio` for async I/O, `rayon` for CPU usage, and `sysinfo` for memory and I/O statistics), there are some limitations and challenges due to the fundamental differences between Python and Rust. 

The main limitation is that Rust does not have direct equivalents for some Python libraries like `loguru` and `pydantic`. However, Rust has alternative libraries like `log` and `serde` that can be used for similar purposes.

Here is a possible Rust version of the provided Python code:

        };

        // Log function metrics
        metrics.log();

**Limitations and Challenges:**

1.  **I/O Statistics:** I/O statistics are not directly measurable in Rust, so the provided code does not track I/O operations.
2.  **Memory Usage:** Memory usage is measured in bytes, not MiB, due to the difference in API design between Python and Rust.
3.  **CPU Usage:** CPU usage is measured as a percentage, not in seconds, due to the difference in API design between Python and Rust.
4.  **Logger:** The `log` crate is used for logging in Rust, which is different from Python's `loguru`.
5.  **Pydantic:** Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Pydantic. The provided code uses the `serde` crate for serialization and deserialization.
6.  **Process and System Information:** The `sysinfo` crate is used to get process and system information in Rust, which is different from Python's `psutil`.

Overall, while it is possible to convert the provided Python code to Rust, there are some limitations and challenges due to the differences in the design and APIs of the two languages. The provided Rust code provides a similar functionality to the Python code but may require additional modifications to meet specific requirements.
