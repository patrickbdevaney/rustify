### Viability of Conversion to Rust
// The conversion of the provided Python script to Rust is partially viable.
// The main reason for this limitation is the Python script does not seem to follow object-oriented programming principles and relies heavily on string formatting and dictionary lookups.
// Rust can handle string formatting and data structures similar to Python dictionaries, but the way this script is structured might require a different approach in Rust.

```rust
// Define a struct to hold conversation stages
struct ConversationStage {
    id: String,
    description: String,
}

// Define a struct to hold the sales agent tools prompt
struct SalesAgentToolsPrompt {
    salesperson_name: String,
    salesperson_role: String,
    company_name: String,
    company_business: String,
    company_values: String,
    conversation_purpose: String,
    conversation_type: String,
    conversation_history: String,
    agent_scratchpad: String,
}

fn main() {
    // Initialize conversation stages
    let conversation_stages = vec![
        ConversationStage {
            id: "1".to_string(),
            description: "Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and respectful while keeping the tone of the conversation professional. Your greeting should be welcoming. Always clarify in your greeting the reason why you are contacting the prospect.".to_string(),
        },
        ConversationStage {
            id: "2".to_string(),
            description: "Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.".to_string(),
        },
        ConversationStage {
            id: "3".to_string(),
            description: "Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. Focus on the unique selling points and value proposition of your product/service that sets it apart from competitors.".to_string(),
        },
        ConversationStage {
            id: "4".to_string(),
            description: "Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.".to_string(),
        },
        ConversationStage {
            id: "5".to_string(),
            description: "Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.".to_string(),
        },
        ConversationStage {
            id: "6".to_string(),
            description: "Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. Be prepared to provide evidence or testimonials to support your claims.".to_string(),
        },
        ConversationStage {
            id: "7".to_string(),
            description: "Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.".to_string(),
        },
    ];

    // Initialize sales agent tools prompt
    let sales_agent_tools_prompt = SalesAgentToolsPrompt {
        salesperson_name: "John Doe".to_string(),
        salesperson_role: "Sales Agent".to_string(),
        company_name: "Example Company".to_string(),
        company_business: "Example Business".to_string(),
        company_values: "Example Values".to_string(),
        conversation_purpose: "Example Purpose".to_string(),
        conversation_type: "Example Type".to_string(),
        conversation_history: "Example History".to_string(),
        agent_scratchpad: "Example Scratchpad".to_string(),
    };

    println!("You are contacting a potential prospect in order to {}.", sales_agent_tools_prompt.conversation_purpose);
    println!("Your means of contacting the prospect is {}.", sales_agent_tools_prompt.conversation_type);

    // Print conversation stages
    for stage in conversation_stages {
        println!("{}: {}", stage.id, stage.description);
    }

    // Start conversation
    println!("Begin!");

    // Previous conversation history
    println!("Previous conversation history: {}", sales_agent_tools_prompt.conversation_history);

    // Agent scratchpad
    println!("{}:", sales_agent_tools_prompt.salesperson_name);
    println!("{}", sales_agent_tools_prompt.agent_scratchpad);

### Limitations and Challenges
The main limitations and challenges of converting this Python script to Rust are:
1. **String Formatting**: Rust's string formatting is different from Python's. In Rust, we use the `format!` macro or the `write!` macro to format strings.
2. **Data Structures**: Rust's data structures are different from Python's. In Rust, we use `Vec` instead of `list`, `HashMap` instead of `dict`, and `struct` instead of `class`.
3. **Error Handling**: Rust's error handling is different from Python's. In Rust, we use the `Result` enum to handle errors.
4. **Loops and Iterators**: Rust's loops and iterators are different from Python's. In Rust, we use `loop`, `while`, `for`, and iterators to loop over data structures.

### Potential Risks
The potential risks of converting this Python script to Rust are:
1. **Data Loss**: If the conversion is not done correctly, data may be lost or corrupted.
2. **Logic Errors**: If the conversion is not done correctly, logic errors may occur, leading to incorrect results.
3. **Performance Issues**: If the conversion is not done correctly, performance issues may occur, leading to slow or inefficient code.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to:
1. **Test the code**: Thoroughly test the code to ensure it works correctly.
2. **Use debugging tools**: Use debugging tools to identify and fix logic errors.
3. **Optimize the code**: Optimize the code to improve performance.

By following these steps, you can ensure a successful conversion of the Python script to Rust.
