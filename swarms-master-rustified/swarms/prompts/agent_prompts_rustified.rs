### Conversion Viability Assessment

The provided Python file can be converted to Rust with some modifications to accommodate Rust's language features and idioms. The file consists mainly of string formatting and dictionary lookups, which are easily translatable to Rust.

However, there are a few areas to consider:

*   Python's dictionaries can be directly translated to Rust's `HashMap`.
*   String formatting in Python can be achieved using Rust's `format!` macro or the `String` type.
*   Python's variable assignments and function definitions are straightforward to translate.
*   The Rust version will need to handle potential errors from `HashMap` lookups and string formatting explicitly, using `Result` or `Option` types.

Here's the equivalent Rust code for the provided Python file:

```rust
// Viable for conversion: Yes
// Reasoning: The file consists mainly of string formatting and dictionary lookups, 
// which are easily translatable to Rust.

use std::collections::HashMap;

// Define a function to generate the agent role prompt
fn generate_agent_role_prompt(agent: &str) -> String {
    // Define a HashMap for agent role prompts
    let prompts: HashMap<&str, &str> = HashMap::from([
        ("Finance Agent", 
            "You are a seasoned finance analyst AI assistant. Your primary goal is to compose comprehensive, astute, impartial, and methodically arranged financial reports based on provided data and trends."),
        ("Travel Agent", 
            "You are a world-travelled AI tour guide assistant. Your main purpose is to draft engaging, insightful, unbiased, and well-structured travel reports on given locations, including history, attractions, and cultural insights."),
        ("Academic Research Agent", 
            "You are an AI academic research assistant. Your primary responsibility is to create thorough, academically rigorous, unbiased, and systematically organized reports on a given research topic, following the standards of scholarly work."),
        ("Default Agent", 
            "You are an AI critical thinker research assistant. Your sole purpose is to write well written, critically acclaimed, objective and structured reports on given text."),
    ]);

    // Get the prompt from the HashMap or return a default value
    prompts.get(agent).unwrap_or(&"No such agent").to_string()
}

// Define a function to generate the report prompt
fn generate_report_prompt(question: &str, research_summary: &str) -> String {
    format!(r#""{}" Using the above information, answer the following question or topic: "{}" in a detailed report -- The report should focus on the answer to the question, should be well structured, informative, in depth, with facts and numbers if available, a minimum of 1,200 words and with markdown syntax and apa format. Write all source urls at the end of the report in apa format"#, research_summary, question)
}

// Define a function to generate the search queries prompt
fn generate_search_queries_prompt(question: &str) -> String {
    format!("Write 4 google search queries to search online that form an objective opinion from the following: \"{}\"You must respond with a list of strings in the following format: [\"query 1\", \"query 2\", \"query 3\", \"query 4\"]", question)
}

// Define a function to generate the resource report prompt
fn generate_resource_report_prompt(question: &str, research_summary: &str) -> String {
    format!(r#""{}" Based on the above information, generate a bibliography recommendation report for the following question or topic: "{}".

Include relevant facts, figures, and numbers whenever available. The report should have a minimum length of 1,200 words."#, research_summary, question)
}

// Define a function to generate the outline report prompt
fn generate_outline_report_prompt(question: &str, research_summary: &str) -> String {
    format!(r#""{}" Using the above information, generate an outline for a research report in Markdown syntax for the following question or topic: "{}". The outline should provide a well-structured framework for the research report, including the main sections, subsections, and key points to be covered. The research report should be detailed, informative, in-depth, and a minimum of 1,200 words. Use appropriate Markdown syntax to format the outline and ensure readability."#, research_summary, question)
}

// Define a function to generate the concepts prompt
fn generate_concepts_prompt(question: &str, research_summary: &str) -> String {
    format!(r#""{}" Using the above information, generate a list of 5 main concepts to learn for a research report on the following question or topic: "{}". The outline should provide a well-structured frameworkYou must respond with a list of strings in the following format: ["concepts 1", "concepts 2", "concepts 3", "concepts 4, concepts 5"]"#, research_summary, question)
}

// Define a function to generate the lesson prompt
fn generate_lesson_prompt(concept: &str) -> String {
    format!("generate a comprehensive lesson about {} in Markdown syntax. This should include the definitionof {}, its historical background and development, its applications or uses in differentfields, and notable events or facts related to {}.", concept, concept, concept)
}

// Define a function to get the report by type
fn get_report_by_type(report_type: &str) -> Option<fn(&str, &str) -> String> {
    match report_type {
        "research_report" => Some(generate_report_prompt),
        "resource_report" => Some(generate_resource_report_prompt),
        "outline_report" => Some(generate_outline_report_prompt),
        _ => None,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let agent_prompt = generate_agent_role_prompt("Finance Agent");
    println!("{}", agent_prompt);

    let report_prompt = generate_report_prompt("What is AI?", "AI is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines.");
    println!("{}", report_prompt);
}
```

**Notes:**

*   In Rust, we need to explicitly handle the potential errors from `HashMap` lookups using `unwrap_or` or `Result`.
*   The string formatting is done using the `format!` macro or the `String` type.
*   We use the `&str` type for string references instead of Python's `str`.
*   The `get_report_by_type` function returns an `Option` to handle the case where the report type is not recognized.
