// Viability of conversion: 
// The provided Python code appears to be a simple function that returns a formatted string. 
// This can be converted to Rust without breaking interoperation with the rest of the repository.
// However, please note that Rust is a statically-typed language and has different string handling mechanisms compared to Python.

// Risks and limitations: 
// - Python's f-strings have been replaced with Rust's string concatenation method. 
// - Rust does not have the same level of string interpolation as Python's f-strings. 
// - Error handling has been omitted in this example for simplicity. 
// - If the task_name is not a string or if it is null, the program will panic.

Challenges in conversion:

- Rust does not have the same level of string interpolation as Python's f-strings. 
- Error handling has been omitted in this example for simplicity. 
- Null or empty task names will cause a panic in this Rust version. In a real-world application, you should add proper error handling. 

Future Enhancements:

- Error handling for null or empty task names can be added using Rust's `Option` and `Result` types. 
- You can consider using a templating engine like `tera` or `askama` to handle complex string interpolation. 
- The generated SOP can be further customized and formatted using various Rust libraries and frameworks. 

Interoperation:

The provided Rust code generates the SOP as a string. This string can be easily used in other Rust applications, including those that require interoperation with Python. However, if you need to directly call the Rust function from Python, consider using a foreign function interface (FFI) like `pyo3` or `rust-cpython`.
