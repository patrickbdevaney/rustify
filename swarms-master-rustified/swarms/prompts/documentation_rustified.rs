// This conversion is PARTIALLY VIABLE.

// While the logic can be converted to Rust, the actual code generation for the documentation will require significant modifications to accommodate Rust's syntax and idioms.
// Additionally, Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Python's f-strings, so the formatting of the documentation string will need to be adjusted.

/// Generates documentation for a given module or framework.
///
/// This function takes in a task and a module name, and returns a string containing the generated documentation.
/// The documentation follows a specific outline, including an overview, class or function definition, functionality and usage, and additional information and tips.
pub fn documentation_writer_sop(task: &str, module: &str) -> String {
    // Define the documentation template
    let mut documentation = format!("
        Create multi-page long and explicit professional documentation for the {} code below follow the outline for the {} library,
        provide many examples and teach the user about the code, provide examples for every function, make the documentation 10,000 words,
        provide many usage examples and note this is markdown docs, create the documentation for the code to document,
        put the arguments and methods in a table in markdown to make it visually seamless

        Now make the professional documentation for this code, provide the architecture and how the class works and why it works that way,
        it's purpose, provide args, their types, 3 ways of usage examples, in examples show all the code like imports main example etc

        BE VERY EXPLICIT AND THOROUGH, MAKE IT DEEP AND USEFUL

        ######## INSTRUCTIONS ########
        Step 1: Understand the purpose and functionality of the module or framework

        Read and analyze the description provided in the documentation to understand the purpose and functionality of the module or framework.
        Identify the key features, parameters, and operations performed by the module or framework.
        Step 2: Provide an overview and introduction

        Start the documentation by providing a brief overview and introduction to the module or framework.
        Explain the importance and relevance of the module or framework in the context of the problem it solves.
        Highlight any key concepts or terminology that will be used throughout the documentation.
        Step 3: Provide a class or function definition

        Provide the class or function definition for the module or framework.
        Include the parameters that need to be passed to the class or function and provide a brief description of each parameter.
        Specify the data types and default values for each parameter.
        Step 4: Explain the functionality and usage

        Provide a detailed explanation of how the module or framework works and what it does.
        Describe the steps involved in using the module or framework, including any specific requirements or considerations.
        Provide code examples to demonstrate the usage of the module or framework.
        Explain the expected inputs and outputs for each operation or function.
        Step 5: Provide additional information and tips

        Provide any additional information or tips that may be useful for using the module or framework effectively.
        Address any common issues or challenges that developers may encounter and provide recommendations or workarounds.
        Step 6: Include references and resources

        Include references to any external resources or research papers that provide further information or background on the module or framework.
        Provide links to relevant documentation or websites for further exploration.
        Example Template for the given documentation:

        ################################### EXAMPLE #####################################
        # Module/Function Name: MultiheadAttention

        ```rust
        // This is where the Rust implementation of the module or framework would go
        ```

        # Implementation of the forward pass of the attention module goes here

        Note:

        The above template includes the class or function definition, parameters, description, and usage example.
        To replicate the documentation for any other module or framework, follow the same structure and provide the specific details for that module or framework.


        ############# DOCUMENT THE FOLLOWING CODE ########
        {}
    ", module, module, task);

    documentation
}
```

### Example Usage:
```rust
fn main() {
    let task = "Implement a neural network";
    let module = "MyModule";
    let documentation = documentation_writer_sop(task, module);
    println!("{}", documentation);
}
```

### Challenges and Limitations:

1.  **Code Generation:** The original Python code generates documentation for PyTorch-like code. In Rust, this would require significant modifications to accommodate Rust's syntax and idioms.
2.  **Syntax and Formatting:** Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Python's f-strings, so the formatting of the documentation string will need to be adjusted.
3.  **Rust Implementation:** The Rust implementation of the module or framework would need to be written separately, as the original Python code is not directly translatable to Rust.

Overall, while the logic of the Python code can be converted to Rust, the actual code generation for the documentation will require significant modifications to accommodate Rust's syntax and idioms.
