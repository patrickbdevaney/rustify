// Viable conversion: Yes
// Reasoning: The provided Python code defines constants and a dictionary (conversation_stages) that map conversation stage numbers to their descriptions.
//             Since Rust is statically typed and does not have a direct equivalent to Python's dictionaries with string keys,
//             we can define an enum for conversation stages in Rust and use a match statement to handle each stage.

### Potential Risks and Limitations:
1.  **Static Typing**: Rust is a statically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is known at compile time. In contrast, Python is dynamically typed, where the data type is determined at runtime. This difference may require adjustments to the code to ensure type safety and compatibility.
2.  **No Direct Equivalent to Python Dictionaries**: Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Python dictionaries. Instead, you can use the `std::collections` module to work with hash maps or other data structures.
3.  **No Direct Equivalent to Python Enum with String Keys**: Rust enums are not directly equivalent to Python enums with string keys. You can define an enum and use a match statement to handle each variant, or use a traits and pattern matching to achieve similar behavior.
4.  **Error Handling**: Rust has a strong focus on error handling and requires explicit handling of potential errors using `Result` and `Option` types. This may require significant changes to the code to handle errors properly.

### Challenges:
1.  **Code Organization**: Rust code often has a different structure and organization than Python code. For example, Rust code typically uses modules and crates to organize code, whereas Python code often uses packages and modules.
2.  **Performance**: Rust code can be more performant than Python code due to its compilation to machine code and lack of runtime overhead. However, this requires careful consideration of performance-critical code paths and optimization techniques.
3.  **Concurrency**: Rust has strong support for concurrency using async/await and the `tokio` crate, whereas Python uses threads and processes. This requires adjustments to the code to ensure proper concurrency handling.

### Recommendations:
1.  **Start with a Small Subset of the Code**: Begin by converting a small, self-contained subset of the Python code to Rust, and gradually build upon it.
2.  **Use Rust's Error Handling Mechanisms**: Take advantage of Rust's error handling mechanisms, such as `Result` and `Option`, to ensure robust and reliable code.
3.  **Leverage Rust's Type System**: Use Rust's type system to ensure type safety and prevent potential type-related errors.
4.  **Consider Performance and Concurrency**: Optimize performance-critical code paths and ensure proper concurrency handling to take advantage of Rust's strengths.
