### Analysis and Conversion of Python Code to Rust

The provided Python file appears to be a template for generating project management prompts. It defines a string template `PROJECT_MANAGR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` that contains placeholders for various project-related information. The `FORMAT_EXAMPLE` string provides an example of how the template can be filled in.

#### Viable Conversion Assessment
Conversion of this Python code to Rust is viable, as it primarily involves string manipulation and does not rely on any Python-specific features that are incompatible with Rust.

#### Potential Risks and Limitations
One potential risk is that the Rust version may not be as flexible as the Python version in terms of string formatting and manipulation. Additionally, Rust's type system and borrow checker may require more explicit type definitions and memory management, which could lead to differences in the code's structure and behavior.

#### Rust Equivalent

```rust
// Viable conversion: YES
// Reasoning: The code primarily involves string manipulation, which can be easily achieved in Rust.

// Define the project manager prompt template
const PROJECT_MANAGER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"
# Context
{context}

## Format example
{format_example}
-----
Role: You are a project manager; the goal is to break down tasks according to PRD/technical design, give a task list, and analyze task dependencies to start with the prerequisite modules
Requirements: Based on the context, fill in the following missing information, note that all sections are returned in Python code triple quote form seperatedly. Here the granularity of the task is a file, if there are any missing files, you can supplement them
Attention: Use '##' to split sections, not '#', and '## <SECTION_NAME>' SHOULD WRITE BEFORE the code and triple quote.

## Required Rust crates: Provided in Cargo.toml format

## Required Other language third-party packages: Provided in requirements.txt format

## Full API spec: Use OpenAPI 3.0. Describe all APIs that may be used by both frontend and backend.

## Logic Analysis: Provided as a Rust Vec<(String, String)>. the first is filename, the second is function/struct should be implemented in this file. Analyze the dependencies between the files, which work should be done first

## Task list: Provided as Rust Vec<String>. Each String is a filename, the more at the beginning, the more it is a prerequisite dependency, should be done first

## Shared Knowledge: Anything that should be public like utils' functions, config's variables details that should make clear first.

## Anything UNCLEAR: Provide as Plain text. Make clear here. For example, don't forget a main entry. don't forget to init 3rd party libs.

}
```

Note that in the Rust version, I replaced the Python-specific formatting and syntax with Rust-specific equivalents. I also changed the `PROJECT_MANAGR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and `FORMAT_EXAMPLE` strings to use Rust's raw string literals (`r#""#`) to avoid issues with string escaping. Additionally, I replaced the Python `list` and `tuple` with Rust's `Vec` and `tuple` equivalents.
