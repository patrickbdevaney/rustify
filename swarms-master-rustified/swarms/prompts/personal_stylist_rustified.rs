// The conversion is viable because the Python code consists only of string constants, 
// which have direct equivalents in Rust as string literals.
// The main challenge in Rust is that string literals are immutable by default. 
// In this case, it's not a problem because we're only defining constants.

**Limitations and Challenges:**

1.  **String Literals:** Rust's string literals are immutable by default. This is not a problem in this case because we're defining constants, but it's something to keep in mind if you're working with mutable strings.
2.  **Raw String Literals:** Rust supports raw string literals, which can be useful for defining multiline strings without the need for concatenation or escaping. These are defined using `r"..."`, `r#"...",#`, `r##"...",##`, etc., and can be used to simplify the definition of the prompts.
3.  **UTF-8 Encoding:** Rust uses UTF-8 encoding for strings by default. This is not a problem in this case because the prompt strings only contain ASCII characters, but it's something to keep in mind if you're working with non-ASCII characters.
4.  **Error Handling:** The code does not include any error handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add error handling to ensure that the program behaves correctly in case of errors.

**Best Practices:**

1.  **Use Meaningful Variable Names:** The variable names `HAIRCUT_STYLIST_AGENT_PROMPT`, `MAKEUP_STYLIST_AGENT_PROMPT`, etc., are already meaningful and descriptive. This makes the code easy to understand and maintain.
2.  **Use Comments:** The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each prompt. This makes the code easy to understand and maintain.
3.  **Use Constants:** The code defines the prompts as constants using `const`. This is a good practice because the prompts are not changed anywhere in the code.
4.  **Avoid Duplicate Code:** The code does not include any duplicate code. This makes the code easy to maintain and reduces the risk of errors.
