// Define a function for replacing placeholders in the prompts

```

In this conversion, I've maintained the original behavior and structure of the Python code. However, there are a few key differences:

1.  **Explicit type definitions**: Rust requires explicit type definitions for variables and constants. I've used the `&str` type to define string constants, as it's the most suitable for this use case.
2.  **String replacement**: Python's f-strings are not directly supported in Rust. Instead, I've implemented a `replace_placeholders` function to replace placeholders in the prompts with actual values. This function uses a `HashMap` to store the replacements and then iterates over the prompt to replace the placeholders.
3.  **Error handling**: Rust is more explicit about error handling compared to Python. In this example, I've not added explicit error handling for simplicity, but in a real-world application, you would need to consider error handling for the `replace_placeholders` function.
4.  **Mutable vs immutable**: In Rust, variables are immutable by default. I've made the `replacements` HashMap mutable by using the `mut` keyword to allow adding elements to it.
