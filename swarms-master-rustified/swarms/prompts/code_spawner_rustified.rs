### Viability of Conversion

The provided Python file, `prompts.py`, contains only string constants and does not include any executable code. Therefore, the conversion to Rust is straightforward and does not pose any significant risks or limitations.

```rust
// Conversion assessment: Viable
// Reasoning: The file contains only string constants and does not require any logic or dependencies that would make conversion to Rust challenging.

// Define constants for the prompts
const IDEA_INTAKE_PROMPT: &str = "
Analyze and expand upon the user's idea, extracting key concepts, requirements, and desired outcomes. Represent the user's idea in a highly detailed structured format, including key features, constraints, and desired outcomes. Idea: {idea}
";

const CODEBASE_PLANNING_PROMPT: &str = "
Develop a high-level plan for the codebase, including directory structure and file organization. Try to keep the number of files to a maximum of 7 for efficiency, and make sure there is one file that ties it all together for the user to run all the code. Design the software architecture to determine the overall structure
of the codebase based on the following requirements: {requirements}
";

const TASK_PLANNING_PROMPT: &str = "
Translate the high-level codebase plan into specific, actionable development tasks. For each identified component or feature in the plan, create a detailed task that includes necessary actions, technologies involved, and expected outcomes. Structure each task to ensure clear guidance for the development team or subsequent AI code generation agents.

High-Level Codebase Plan: {codebase_plan}

Guidelines for Task Planning:
- Identify distinct components or features from the codebase plan.
- For each component or feature, specify the development tasks required.
- Include any imports, technology stacks, frameworks, or libraries that should be used.
- Detail the expected outcomes or objectives for each task.
- Format the tasks as structured data for easy parsing and automation.
";

const FILE_WRITING_PROMPT: &str = "
Generate individual code files based on the codebase plan. Write code in the specified programming language using programming language 
generation techniques. For each file required by the project, 
please include the one-word file name wrapped in tags <!--START_FILE_PATH--> and <!--END_FILE_PATH-->, followed by the file content wrapped in
<!--START_CONTENT--> and <!--END_CONTENT--> tags. Ensure each file's details are clearly separated. Here are the details: {details}
";

const CODE_REVIEW_PROMPT: &str = "
Analyze the generated code for correctness, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. Meticulously review the codebase to find any errors, bugs, missing imports, improper integration,or broken logic. Output a detailed list of improvements for our engineering team including all issues (ESPECIALLY import issue) and how to fix them. Here is the code: {code}.
";

const CODE_REFACTORING_PROMPT: &str = "
Given the code provided, refactor it to improve its structure, maintainability, and extensibility. Ensure the refactored code adheres to best practices and addresses the specified areas for improvement. 

When presenting the refactored code, use the same format as in the file writing step: Wrap the one-word file name with <!--START_FILE_PATH--> and <!--END_FILE_PATH--> tags, and enclose the file content with <!--START_CONTENT--> and <!--END_CONTENT--> tags. ENSURE that the end of your output contains an \"<!--END_CONTENT-->\" tag. This format will facilitate direct parsing and saving as individual code files.

Areas to improve: {improvements}

The code to refactor:
{code}


Note: The expectation is that the refactored code will be structured and tagged appropriately for automated parsing and saving as individual code files.
";

const GITHUB_PUSH_PROMPT: &str = "
Push the final codebase to a GitHub repository. Manage code changes and maintain a history of revisions using version control integration. Here are the final changes: {changes}
";
```

### Challenges and Limitations

*   The file contains long multiline strings, which may be difficult to work with in Rust. However, Rust supports multiline strings using the `"""` syntax.
*   There are placeholders (`{idea}`, `{requirements}`, `{codebase_plan}`, etc.) in the prompts, but these are not specific to Python and can be replaced with the corresponding values in Rust.
*   The file does not use any external dependencies or Python-specific features that would make conversion to Rust challenging.

### Compatibility with the Rest of the Project

Since the file only contains string constants, compatibility with the rest of the project should not be an issue. However, the following factors should be considered:

*   The Rust code should be able to replace the Python code without affecting the functionality of the rest of the project.
*   The Rust code should be able to handle the same input and produce the same output as the Python code.
*   The Rust code should be able to interact with other components of the project, such as other Rust or Python modules, without any issues.

Overall, the conversion of `prompts.py` to Rust is straightforward and viable. The resulting Rust code can replace the Python code without affecting the functionality of the rest of the project.
