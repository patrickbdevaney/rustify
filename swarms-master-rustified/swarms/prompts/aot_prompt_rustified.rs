### Conversion Viability:
// The conversion of the given Python file is viable because it does not rely on any complex Python-specific features that do not have direct Rust equivalents.
// However, note that the Rust version of this code will be slightly more verbose due to Rust's emphasis on type safety and explicitness.

Here is the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
/// This function systematically breaks down the given objective into distinct, manageable subtasks.
/// It structures the problem-solving process through explicit step-by-step exploration,
/// using a methodical search tree approach. Key steps are numbered to guide the exploration of solutions.
///
/// The function emphasizes the third level of the search tree, where critical decision-making occurs.
/// Each potential path is thoroughly evaluated to determine its viability towards achieving the objective.
/// The process includes:
/// - Identifying initial steps in the search tree.
/// - Delineating and exploring critical third-level decisions.
/// - Considering alternative paths if initial trials are not promising.
///
/// The goal is to think atomically and provide solutions for each subtask identified,
/// leading to a conclusive final result. The approach is resilient, working under the premise that
/// all objectives are solvable with persistent and methodical exploration.

fn algorithm_of_thoughts_sop(objective: &str) -> String {
    // Define the prompt as a multiline string
    let aot_prompt = format!(r#"

    ### OBJECTIVE
    {objective}
    ###
    
    "#);
    
    // Return the formatted prompt
    aot_prompt
}

fn main() {
    // Example usage:
    let objective = "Example Objective";
    let prompt = algorithm_of_thoughts_sop(objective);
    println!("{}", prompt);
}

### Compatibility and Challenges:
- **String Formatting:** Rust uses the `format!` macro to create formatted strings, which is similar to Python's f-strings. However, Rust requires explicit type definitions, which can make the code more verbose.
- **String Concatenation:** Rust's `format!` macro can handle multiline strings and concatenation seamlessly, which is equivalent to Python's triple quotes for multiline strings.
- **Memory Management:** Rust's ownership and borrowing system handles memory management, which eliminates the need for manual memory allocation or garbage collection.
- **Exception Handling:** Rust uses a concept called "Result" to handle errors, which is different from Python's try-except block. However, this example does not involve error handling, so it is not applicable here.
- **Performance:** Rust's emphasis on performance and safety may result in faster execution times compared to Python, especially for computationally intensive tasks.
- **Interoperation:** Since this code only involves basic string manipulation, it should integrate well with other Rust components. However, when interacting with Python code, consider using libraries like `pyo3` for seamless integration between Rust and Python.
