### Meta-Prompter Template for Agent-Based Task Prompt Generation

**Objective**: To create a comprehensive system prompt that directs an intelligent agent to produce a specific and useful response for a given task or scenario. Only Return the prompt for the agent you're instructing. Nothing else


1. **Clarify the Task Objective**: 
    - Clearly articulate the primary goal or the specific outcome expected from the agent's task.
    - Highlight the core problem or question the agent needs to address.

2. **Establish Key Requirements**:
    - Enumerate any crucial requirements or limitations for the agent's response, such as response length, format, or the inclusion/exclusion of certain types of information.
    - Outline the expected depth of detail or complexity in the response.

3. **Provide Essential Context**:
    - Offer relevant background or contextual information to ensure the agent's responses are accurate and pertinent.
    - Indicate any necessary assumptions or preset conditions that the agent should consider.

4. **Determine the Interaction Style**:
    - Define the desired tone and style for the agent's responses, whether it be professional, casual, instructional, or another specified tone.
    - If appropriate, mention the need for elements like humor, empathy, or formality in the response.

5. **Outline Feedback and Iteration Processes**:
    - Describe the method for evaluating the effectiveness of the agent's responses and the mechanism for providing feedback.
    - Explain how the prompt might be refined or iterated upon based on the outcomes of initial responses.

6. **Incorporate Examples**:
    - Provide example responses to illustrate the desired outcome clearly. This can include both positive examples (what to aim for) and negative examples (what to avoid).
    - Examples should serve as a clear guide for the type of response expected from the agent.

7. **Iterative Refinement**:
    - Review the draft prompt to ensure it aligns with the task objective and is clear and comprehensive.
    - Consider testing the prompt in a small-scale setting to identify any potential improvements.

### Example Meta-Prompt Creation:

- **Objective**: Generate a prompt for an intelligent agent to devise innovative community project ideas that promote sustainability.
- **Key Requirements**: Ideas must be actionable with local resources, involve community participation, and be achievable within a six-month timeframe.
- **Context and Background**: Assume the community has access to a public garden space and a modest fund for environmental projects.
- **Interaction Style**: The response should inspire community involvement, using an uplifting and motivational tone.
- **Feedback Loop**: Projects will be assessed based on creativity, community impact, and sustainability. Feedback will guide the refinement of future prompts.
- **Examples**: 
    - Desired response example: "Organize a 'green market' where local vendors and farmers can sell sustainably produced goods."
    - Undesired response example: "Launch a large-scale solar farm initiative." (While beneficial, this exceeds the scope of community-led efforts and available resources.)

### Key Points:

*   **Conversion Feasibility:** The given Python code can be directly translated into Rust since it's a multi-line string.
*   **Rust Implementation:** The Rust code consists of a single constant `META_PROMPTER_TEMPLATE` that holds the template string. 
*   **Template Usage:** In the `main` function, the template is printed to the console. This demonstrates how to access and use the template in a Rust program.
*   **Interoperability:** The Rust code maintains compatibility with the rest of the project since it only deals with a static string constant.

### Limitations and Challenges:

*   If the Python code is modified to include dynamic logic, such as templating engines or runtime string manipulation, the Rust equivalent might require additional libraries or a different approach.
*   If the template is intended to be used across multiple modules or files, you may need to explore Rust's module and crate systems to manage access and reusability efficiently.
*   Any subsequent processing or manipulation of the template string in Python would require equivalent Rust logic, potentially involving different data structures or libraries.

Overall, the conversion from Python to Rust for this specific code is straightforward, but consider potential limitations and challenges when dealing with more complex logic or cross-language operability.
