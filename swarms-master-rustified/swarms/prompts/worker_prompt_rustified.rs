// The main difficulties come from converting Python's dynamic typing and the pydantic library to Rust's static typing and equivalent libraries like serde.
// Additionally, Python's flexibility with functions as first-class citizens and its type hinting system might require additional handling in Rust.
// However, these challenges can be overcome with careful consideration and use of Rust's features.

**Porting the original codebase from Python to Rust can be challenging, but with care, it is largely possible.**

Care should be taken with:

1.  **Error Handling**: Python often lets errors pass through without raising warnings, whereas Rust requires explicit error handling, which can sometimes make the code longer.
2.  **Type Conversions**: Rust is statically typed, whereas Python is dynamically typed. When porting the code from Python, Rust will sometimes require type casting or boxing.
3.  **Serialization/Deserialization**: When deserializing/serializing from JSON, consider edge cases such as expected types, missing keys, and type misinterpretation.
4.  **Compatibility**: Ensure that all external libraries in Python have an equivalent library in Rust.
5.  **Testing**: This should be done across both Python and Rust to catch any inconsistencies or errors that may have crept into the ported version.
6.  **Rust's Borrow Checker**: Understand and learn how to work with Rust's Borrow Checker as this is crucial when handling references and ownership.
7.  **Null or Empty Values**: Python will sometimes accept null or empty values, while Rust's type system may require you to use Options or Result to specify and handle such cases.
