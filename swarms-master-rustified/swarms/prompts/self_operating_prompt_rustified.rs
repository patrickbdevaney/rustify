### Conversion Viability Assessment
The provided Python code is primarily composed of string formatting and variable replacements. This functionality is readily available in Rust, making the conversion viable. However, it's essential to note that Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on memory safety and performance, which might not be directly relevant to this specific code snippet. Nevertheless, the conversion can be performed without significant challenges.

### Converted Rust Code
```rust
/// Module for generating vision prompts and summary prompts.
///
/// This module provides functions for formatting vision prompts and summary prompts
/// based on the provided objective and previous action.

// Define constants for vision prompt and summary prompt.
const VISION_PROMPT: &str = r#"
You are a Self-Operating Computer. You use the same operating system as a human.

From looking at the screen and the objective your goal is to take the best next action. 

To operate the computer you have the four options below. 

1. CLICK - Move mouse and click
2. TYPE - Type on the keyboard
3. SEARCH - Search for a program on Mac and open it
4. DONE - When you completed the task respond with the exact following phrase content

Here are the response formats below. 

1. CLICK
Response: CLICK {{ "x": "percent", "y": "percent", "description": "~description here~", "reason": "~reason here~" }} 

2. TYPE
Response: TYPE "value you want to type"

2. SEARCH
Response: SEARCH "app you want to search for on Mac"

3. DONE
Response: DONE

Here are examples of how to respond.
__
Objective: Follow up with the vendor in outlook
TYPE Hello, I hope you are doing well. I wanted to follow up
__
Objective: Open Spotify and play the beatles
SEARCH Spotify
__
Objective: Find a image of a banana
CLICK {{ "x": "50%", "y": "60%", "description": "Click: Google Search field", "reason": "This will allow me to search for a banana" }} 
__
Objective: Go buy a book about the history of the internet
TYPE https://www.amazon.com/
__

A few important notes: 

- Default to opening Google Chrome with SEARCH to find things that are on the internet. 
- Go to Google Docs and Google Sheets by typing in the Chrome Address bar
- When opening Chrome, if you see a profile icon click that to open chrome fully, it is located at: {{ "x": "50%", "y": "55%" }} 
- The Chrome address bar is generally at: {{ "x": "50%", "y": "9%" }}
- After you click to enter a field you can go ahead and start typing!

{previous_action}

IMPORTANT: Avoid repeating actions such as doing the same CLICK event twice in a row. 

Objective: {objective}
"#;

const SUMMARY_PROMPT: &str = r#"
You are a Self-Operating Computer. You just completed a request from a user by operating the computer. Now you need to share the results. 

You have three pieces of key context about the completed request.

1. The original objective
2. The steps you took to reach the objective that are available in the previous messages
3. The screenshot you are looking at.

Now you need to summarize what you did to reach the objective. If the objective asked for information, share the information that was requested. IMPORTANT: Don't forget to answer a user's question if they asked one.

Thing to note: The user can not respond to your summary. You are just sharing the results of your work.

The original objective was: {objective}

Now share the results!
"#;

const USER_QUESTION: &str = "Hello, I can help you with anything. What would you like done?";

/// Format the summary prompt with the provided objective.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `objective`: The objective to be included in the summary prompt.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The formatted summary prompt.
fn format_summary_prompt(objective: &str) -> String {
    SUMMARY_PROMPT.replace("{objective}", objective)
}

/// Format the vision prompt with the provided objective and previous action.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `objective`: The objective to be included in the vision prompt.
/// * `previous_action`: The previous action to be included in the vision prompt.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The formatted vision prompt.
fn format_vision_prompt(objective: &str, previous_action: Option<&str>) -> String {
    let mut prompt = VISION_PROMPT.to_string();
    if let Some(action) = previous_action {
        let previous_action_str = format!("Here was the previous action you took: {}", action);
        prompt = prompt.replace("{previous_action}", &previous_action_str);
    } else {
        prompt = prompt.replace("{previous_action}", "");
    }
    prompt = prompt.replace("{objective}", objective);
    prompt
}

fn main() {
    let objective = "Test Objective";
    let previous_action = Some("Test Previous Action");
    let summary_prompt = format_summary_prompt(objective);
    let vision_prompt = format_vision_prompt(objective, previous_action);
    println!("Summary Prompt: {}", summary_prompt);
    println!("Vision Prompt: {}", vision_prompt);
}
```

### Limitations and Challenges
The primary challenge in this conversion was handling the string replacements for the objective and previous action. Rust's `replace` method is used to achieve this, which is similar to Python's `format` method.

Another consideration was the use of `Option` to handle the case where `previous_action` might be `None`. This is a more idiomatic way to handle optional values in Rust.

Overall, the conversion was straightforward, and the resulting Rust code maintains the same functionality as the original Python code. However, it's essential to note that Rust's focus on memory safety and performance might not be directly relevant to this specific code snippet.
