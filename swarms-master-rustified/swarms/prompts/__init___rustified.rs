### Analysis and Conversion

The provided Python file appears to be a module that imports and exports various constants related to prompts and a documentation writer. It does not contain any complex logic or functionality that would pose significant challenges for conversion to Rust.

**Conversion Viability:** Viable

The conversion is considered viable because the file primarily deals with importing and exporting constants, which is a straightforward process in Rust.

### Rust Equivalent

```rust
// Viable conversion: The file only contains imports and exports, making it straightforward to convert to Rust.
// However, the Rust equivalent requires manual representation of the prompt structs and their implementations,
// as Rust does not support dynamic imports like Python, and we need to manually handle the interoperation with the rest of the repository.

// Assuming the prompts and documentation writer are defined in their respective modules
mod code_interpreter;
mod documentation;
mod finance_agent_prompt;
mod growth_agent_prompt;
mod legal_agent_prompt;
mod operations_agent_prompt;
mod product_agent_prompt;
mod prompt;

pub use code_interpreter::CODE_INTERPRETER;
pub use documentation::DOCUMENTATION_WRITER_SOP;
pub use finance_agent_prompt::FINANCE_AGENT_PROMPT;
pub use growth_agent_prompt::GROWTH_AGENT_PROMPT;
pub use legal_agent_prompt::LEGAL_AGENT_PROMPT;
pub use operations_agent_prompt::OPERATIONS_AGENT_PROMPT;
pub use product_agent_prompt::PRODUCT_AGENT_PROMPT;
pub use prompt::Prompt;
```

**Challenges and Limitations:**

1. **Manual Representation:** In Rust, we need to manually represent the prompt structs and their implementations. This requires a good understanding of the original Python code and its functionality.
2. **Interoperation:** To maintain interoperation with the rest of the repository, we need to ensure that the Rust code can work seamlessly with the existing Python code. This may require creating Rust wrappers around Python functions or using a foreign function interface (FFI) like `pyo3`.
3. **Error Handling:** Rust has a strong focus on error handling, which may require additional code to handle potential errors that could occur during the execution of the prompts or documentation writer.

### Advice for Conversion

1. **Start with a Small Subset:** Begin by converting a small subset of the prompts and documentation writer to Rust, and then gradually add more functionality.
2. **Use Rust's Error Handling Mechanisms:** Leverage Rust's error handling mechanisms, such as `Result` and `Option`, to handle potential errors that could occur during execution.
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Write comprehensive tests to ensure that the Rust code behaves as expected and maintains interoperation with the rest of the repository.
4. **Consider Using a Rust-Python FFI:** If the Rust code needs to interact closely with the existing Python code, consider using a Rust-Python FFI like `pyo3` to facilitate the interaction.
