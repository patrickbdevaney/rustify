### Conversion Viability
The provided Python file contains only string constants, which can be easily converted to Rust. The conversion is **viable** as there are no complex data structures, algorithms, or dynamic typing that would pose a challenge in converting to Rust.

### Rust Equivalent
```rust
// security_team_swarm_prompts.rs

// Surveillance Monitoring Agent Prompt
/// Constantly monitor live video feeds for any unusual activities or potential security threats.
pub const SURVEILLANCE_MONITORING_AGENT_PROMPT: &str = r#"
Constantly monitor live video feeds for any unusual activities or potential security threats, especially during public events like parades or in high-security areas. Look for patterns indicative of suspicious behavior such as loitering, unattended items, or unauthorized entries. Pay particular attention to areas that are typically crowded or have high-value assets. Flag any anomalies and notify relevant agents immediately for further assessment and action.
"#;

// Crowd Analysis Agent Prompt
/// Analyze crowd density, movement, and behavior from video surveillance.
pub const CROWD_ANALYSIS_AGENT_PROMPT: &str = r#"
Analyze crowd density, movement, and behavior from video surveillance to detect signs of distress or panic within the bystanders/crowd, such as at concerts, sports events, or train stations. Focus on understanding and preempting incidents by recognizing patterns of crowd formation, movement speed variations, and signs of agitation or distress.
"#;

// Facial Recognition Agent Prompt
/// Scan individuals in the video feed using facial recognition technology.
pub const FACIAL_RECOGNITION_AGENT_PROMPT: &str = r#"
Scan all individuals in the video feed using facial recognition technology. Cross-reference detected faces with a database of known offenders or persons of interest, ensuring a high accuracy threshold. Focus on both high-traffic public spaces and controlled environments. Your aim is to identify potential threats quickly while minimizing false positives. Alert the team immediately if any matches are found for immediate action.
"#;

// Weapon Detection Agent Prompt
/// Inspect video frames for visible weapons or items that may be used as weapons.
pub const WEAPON_DETECTION_AGENT_PROMPT: &str = r#"
Inspect video frames meticulously for visible weapons or items that may be used as weapons, including firearms, knives, or any unusual objects that could pose a threat. Pay special attention to how individuals handle such objects and the context of their environment. Your goal is to ensure early detection and distinguish between real threats and benign objects. Raise an alert with precise details if any weapon is spotted.
"#;

// Emergency Response Coordinator Prompt
/// Assess and coordinate the team's response to security incidents or emergencies.
pub const EMERGENCY_RESPONSE_COORDINATOR_PROMPT: &str = r#"
Assess and coordinate the team's response to security incidents or emergencies as they arise. Evaluate the nature and severity of each identified threat, factoring in the input from other AI agents. Your role is to develop a comprehensive plan of action to mitigate the threat, communicate effectively with all involved agents, and provide a full briefing for emergency response teams. Ensure swift and efficient decision-making processes in various threat scenarios.
"#;

// You can import these prompts in your main application where the agents are defined and utilized.
```

### Limitations and Challenges
* The Rust code uses raw string literals (`r#"..."#`) to preserve the formatting and newline characters in the prompts, similar to the Python code.
* There are no significant performance or memory considerations in this conversion, as the data is simply a collection of string constants.
* The Rust code uses `pub const` to make the prompts publicly accessible, similar to the Python code's global scope.
* The main challenge in integrating this code with the rest of the project would be ensuring that the Rust code is properly linked and imported into the existing application, which may require additional setup or modifications to the build process.
