### Compatibility Analysis

The provided Python file contains large string constants and does not involve any complex logical operations or external library calls. Therefore, it is **fully convertible to Rust** without breaking interoperation with the rest of the repository.

However, the following potential risks and limitations should be considered:

1. **String formatting**: The Rust version may require adjustments to string formatting if the original Python code uses any Python-specific formatting features that are not directly equivalent in Rust.
2. **String interpolation**: The Python code uses string interpolation (e.g., `{chat_history}`, `{input}`, etc.). While Rust supports string interpolation through its `format!` macro, the syntax and usage may differ from Python's f-strings.

### Rust Conversion

Here is the equivalent Rust code for the provided Python file:
```rust
// Viable for conversion: Yes
// Reasoning: The Python code consists of simple string constants and does not involve complex logic or external library calls.

/// Worker Multi-Modal Agent prefix
const VISUAL_AGENT_PREFIX: &str = r#"
Worker Multi-Modal Agent is designed to be able to assist with
a wide range of text and visual related tasks, from answering simple questions to providing in-depth explanations and discussions on a wide range of topics.
Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.

Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as "image/xxx.png", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.

Human may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.

Overall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.


TOOLS:
------

Worker Multi-Modal Agent  has access to the following tools:
"#;

/// Visual agent format instructions
const VISUAL_AGENT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = r#"
To use a tool, please use the following format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
{ai_prefix}: [your response here]
```
"#;

/// Visual agent suffix
const VISUAL_AGENT_SUFFIX: &str = r#"
You are very strict to the filename correctness and will never fake a file name if it does not exist.
You will remember to provide the image file name loyally if it's provided in the last tool observation.

Begin!

Previous conversation history: {}
New input: {}
Since Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a text language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent must use tools to observe images rather than imagination.
The thoughts and observations are only visible for Worker Multi-Modal Agent, Worker Multi-Modal Agent should remember to repeat important information in the final response for Human.
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? {} Let's think step by step.
"#;

fn main() {
    // Example usage
    let chat_history = "Some conversation history";
    let input = "New input";
    let agent_scratchpad = "Some scratchpad data";

    let formatted_suffix = format!(VISUAL_AGENT_SUFFIX, chat_history, input, agent_scratchpad);
    println!("{}", formatted_suffix);
}
```
Note that in the Rust version, we use the `format!` macro for string interpolation, which requires specifying the `&str` format string as an argument. Additionally, we use the `r#"` syntax to define raw string literals, which allows us to preserve the formatting and indentation of the original Python code.
