Now, when you 99% sure you have completed the task, you may follow the instructions below to escape the autonomous loop.

When you have finished the task from the Human, output a special token: <DONE>
This will enable you to leave the autonomous loop.

    You've been granted tools to assist users by always providing outputs in JSON format for tool usage. 
    Whenever a tool usage is required, you must output the JSON wrapped inside markdown for clarity. 
    Provide a commentary on the tool usage and the user's request and ensure that the JSON output adheres to the tool's schema.
    
    Here are some rules:
    Do not ever use tools that do not have JSON schemas attached to them.
    Do not use tools that you have not been granted access to.
    Do not use tools that are not relevant to the task at hand.
    Do not use tools that are not relevant to the user's request.
    
    
    Here are the guidelines you must follow:

    1. **Output Format**:
    - All outputs related to tool usage should be formatted as JSON.
    - The JSON should be encapsulated within triple backticks and tagged as a code block with 'json'.

    2. **Schema Compliance**:
    - Ensure that the JSON output strictly follows the provided schema for each tool.
    - Each tool's schema will define the structure and required fields for the JSON output.

    3. **Schema Example**:
    If a tool named `example_tool` with a schema requires `param1` and `param2`, your response should look like:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
        "name": "example_tool",
        "parameters": {
            "param1": 123,
            "param2": "example_value"
        }
        }
    }
    ```

    4. **Error Handling**:
    - If there is an error or the information provided by the user is insufficient to generate a valid JSON, respond with an appropriate error message in JSON format, also encapsulated in markdown.

    Remember, clarity and adherence to the schema are paramount. Your primary goal is to ensure the user receives well-structured JSON outputs that align with the tool's requirements.

    ---

    Here is the format you should always follow for your responses involving tool usage:

    ```json
    {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "<tool_name>",
        "parameters": {
            "param1": "<value1>",
            "param2": "<value2>"
        }
    }
    }
    ```

    Please proceed with your task accordingly.
    "#;
    prompt.to_string()
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", tool_sop_prompt());
}
```

### Compatibility Considerations and Challenges:

1. **Interoperation**: While Rust is compatible with many languages in terms of data formats (like JSON), direct function calls between Rust and Python (or other languages) require interoperability solutions like foreign function interfaces or frameworks that facilitate cross-language calls.
2. **Memory Management**: Rust's ownership and borrowing system is different from Python's garbage collection. This could lead to challenges in memory management if the Rust code needs to interface closely with Python or other languages that handle memory differently.
3. **Libraries and Frameworks**: Python and Rust have different ecosystems of libraries. While Rust can generate or consume JSON (using libraries like `serde_json`), ensuring compatibility with specific Python libraries or the broader Rust ecosystem might require additional considerations or wrapper libraries.
4. **Error Handling**: Rust's error handling system is based on `Result` and `Option` types, which are more explicit than Python's exceptions. While Rust's approach can provide stronger guarantees about error handling, integrating Rust code with Python (or other languages) may require careful consideration of error propagation across language boundaries.

### Limitations:

- **Language Differences**: Direct translations might not always be possible due to differences in language paradigms (e.g., Rust is statically typed, whereas Python is dynamically typed).
- **Integration Challenges**: The success of integrating Rust code into a larger Python project depends on the specific requirements and the interfaces between components. In some cases, using foreign function interfaces or creating RESTful APIs might be necessary to enable communication between Rust and Python components.

Overall, while the provided Python code can be translated into Rust, doing so requires a thoughtful approach to interoperation, error handling, and managing differences in language characteristics.
