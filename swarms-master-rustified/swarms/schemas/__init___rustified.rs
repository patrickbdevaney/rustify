```rust
// This conversion is mostly viable, as it only involves importing and re-exporting modules.
// However, the actual implementation of the imported types (Step, ManySteps, AgentSchema) 
// and their compatibility with Rust would depend on their definitions in the swarms.schemas module.
// If these types are defined using Python-specific features, their direct conversion to Rust might be challenging.

// In Rust, we don't have a direct equivalent of Python's __all__ variable for controlling 
// module exports. Instead, we use the pub keyword to make items publicly accessible.

pub use swarms::schemas::agent_step_schemas::{Step, ManySteps};
pub use swarms::schemas::agent_input_schema::AgentSchema;
```

**Detailed Feedback on Compatibility:**

1. **Module Import**: The Python code imports modules using the `from` keyword, which is not directly equivalent in Rust. In Rust, we use the `use` keyword for importing modules.
2. **Type Import**: The code imports specific types (`Step`, `ManySteps`, `AgentSchema`) from other modules. If these types are defined using Python-specific features, their direct conversion to Rust might be challenging.
3. **__all__ Variable**: The `__all__` variable is used in Python to control which symbols are imported when using the `from module import *` syntax. In Rust, we don't have a direct equivalent, and instead, use the `pub` keyword to make items publicly accessible.
4. **Re-exporting**: The code re-exports the imported types using the `__all__` variable. In Rust, we can achieve similar functionality using the `pub use` statement.

**Potential Risks and Limitations:**

1. **Type Compatibility**: If the types imported from other modules are defined using Python-specific features, their conversion to Rust might require significant changes or workarounds.
2. **Module Organization**: The Rust code assumes that the `swarms` module is organized similarly to the Python code, with the same sub-modules and types. If the Rust module organization differs, the imports and re-exports might need to be adjusted accordingly.
3. **Namespace Pollution**: The use of `pub use` statements can lead to namespace pollution if not managed carefully, potentially causing naming conflicts or making it harder to identify the origin of certain types or functions.

**Challenge Highlights:**

1. **Type Conversion**: Converting the imported types to Rust equivalents might require significant effort, especially if they rely heavily on Python-specific features.
2. **Module Organization**: Ensuring that the Rust module organization aligns with the Python code's structure is crucial for maintaining compatibility and avoiding naming conflicts.
3. **Namespace Management**: Carefully managing the use of `pub use` statements and maintaining a clean namespace is essential to avoid conflicts and ensure the code remains maintainable.
