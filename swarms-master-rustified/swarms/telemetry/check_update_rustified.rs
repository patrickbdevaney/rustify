### Conversion Viability: Partly Viable

The given Python code can be partially converted to Rust. However, Rust's ecosystem and standard library differ significantly from Python's, especially regarding package management and HTTP requests. This conversion will require using external crates to achieve equivalent functionality.

### Limitations and Challenges:

1. **Package Management:** Rust uses Cargo for package management, which is vastly different from Python's pip and pkg_resources. Checking for package updates and installations will require a different approach.
2. **HTTP Requests:** Rust's standard library does not provide a built-in way to make HTTP requests. An external crate like `reqwest` will be necessary.
3. **Version Parsing:** Rust has a `semver` crate that can be used for version parsing, similar to Python's `packaging.version`.
4. **Logging:** Rust has several logging frameworks, such as `log` and `log4rs`. We will use the `log` crate for simplicity.
5. **Import and Module Handling:** Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Python's dynamic module importing. However, for the purpose of checking if a package (or in Rust terms, a crate) is available, we can use the `cargo` command-line tool or parse the `Cargo.toml` file directly.

### Rust Equivalent:

```rust
// This Rust code achieves a similar purpose but uses different methods
// due to ecosystem differences. Package management, HTTP requests, and
// version parsing are handled using Rust-specific crates.

// Import necessary crates
use log::{info, error};
use semver::Version;
use reqwest;
use std::process::Command;

// Initialize logger
fn initialize_logger() {
    env_logger::init();
}

// Check if a crate (Rust package) is available
fn check_for_crate(crate_name: &str) -> bool {
    // For simplicity, assume we have a Cargo.toml file listing our dependencies
    // In a real application, you might want to parse Cargo.toml or use the cargo command
    let output = Command::new("cargo")
        .arg("tree")
        .output()
        .expect("failed to execute process");
    let output_str = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout);

    output_str.contains(crate_name)
}

// Check for updates
fn check_for_update() -> bool {
    initialize_logger();

    // Fetch the latest version from the Cargo registry
    let resp = reqwest::get("https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/swarms")
        .expect("Failed to fetch data");
    let json: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(&resp.text().expect("Failed to read response"))
        .expect("Failed to parse JSON");

    // Extract the latest version
    let latest_version = json["crate"]["newest_version"].as_str().unwrap();

    // Get the current version from Cargo.toml
    let mut current_version = String::new();
    // This is a very simplified way to read the version. In a real application,
    // consider using a more robust method like toml parsing or cargo commands.
    let cargo_toml = std::fs::read_to_string("Cargo.toml").expect("Failed to read Cargo.toml");
    for line in cargo_toml.lines() {
        if line.starts_with("version") {
            current_version = line.splitpediaOnce('=').unwrap().1.trim().to_string();
            break;
        }
    }

    // Compare versions
    let latest = Version::parse(latest_version).unwrap();
    let current = Version::parse(&current_version).unwrap();

    if latest > current {
        info!("Update available: {} > {}", latest_version, current_version);
        true
    } else {
        info!("No update available: {} <= {}", latest_version, current_version);
        false
    }
}

fn main() {
    if check_for_crate("swarms") {
        if check_for_update() {
            println!("Update available");
        } else {
            println!("No update available");
        }
    } else {
        println!("Swarms crate not found");
    }
}
```

### Dependencies for `Cargo.toml`:

To compile and run this Rust code, ensure your `Cargo.toml` includes the following dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
log = "0.4.14"
env_logger = "0.9.0"
semver = "0.10.0"
reqwest = "0.11.10"
serde_json = "1.0.85"
```

### Notes:

1. The Rust equivalent of checking for a package update involves fetching data from the Cargo registry instead of PyPI. This example is simplified for educational purposes and might require adjustments to fit into a larger project, such as error handling and parsing the `Cargo.toml` file.
2. The code assumes the `swarms` crate is listed as a dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file. In a real application, consider a more robust method for version comparison and package management.
3. Rust's `semver` crate is used for parsing and comparing versions, similar to Python's `packaging.version`.
4. Error handling and logging mechanisms are simplified in this example for clarity. In a production environment, consider more robust logging and error handling strategies.
