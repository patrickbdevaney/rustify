### Viability Assessment
The provided Python code can be converted to Rust, but it requires considerations for the following reasons:
- The `swarms.utils` module and its function `extract_code_from_markdown` need to be available in Rust or re-implemented.
- The `pytest` framework needs to be replaced with Rust's testing library.
- The code uses Python-specific features like strings with multi-line support and dynamic typing, which need to be adapted for Rust.

### Limitations and Challenges
- **External Dependencies**: The Python code relies on `swarms.utils` and `pytest`. In Rust, we would need to either implement these functionalities ourselves or find equivalent crates.
- **Error Handling**: Python's `try-except` block for handling `TypeError` will be replaced with Rust's error handling mechanisms (e.g., `Result` and `?` operator).
- **Test Framework**: Rust has its built-in test framework, which is different from `pytest`.

### Rust Conversion
Given the original Python code and assuming a simple implementation for `extract_code_from_markdown` (since its actual implementation is not provided), here's a basic conversion of the Python code into Rust. Note that this example does not include a full implementation of `extract_code_from_markdown` but rather a placeholder to demonstrate how the rest of the code could be structured.

```rust
// conversion_status: Viable with modifications.
// Reasoning: The code structure can be translated but requires adjustments for Rust's type system and the lack of direct equivalents for some Python features.

// Import the standard library's testing module
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use std::panic;

    // A simplified implementation of extract_code_from_markdown for demonstration purposes
    fn extract_code_from_markdown(markdown_content: &str) -> String {
        // Simulate extraction: This should ideally parse markdown and extract code blocks
        if markdown_content.is_empty() {
            String::new()
        } else {
            markdown_content.to_string()
        }
    }

    // Test fixture equivalent
    fn markdown_content_with_code() -> &'static str {
        "# This is a markdown document
    Some intro text here.
Some additional text."
    }

    // Another test fixture equivalent
    fn markdown_content_without_code() -> &'static str {
        "# This is a markdown document
    There is no code in this document."
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_extract_code_from_markdown_with_code() {
        let markdown = markdown_content_with_code();
        let extracted_code = extract_code_from_markdown(markdown);
        assert!(extracted_code.is_empty()); // Note: This assertion will fail based on the simplified implementation
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_extract_code_from_markdown_without_code() {
        let markdown = markdown_content_without_code();
        let extracted_code = extract_code_from_markdown(markdown);
        assert!(extracted_code.is_empty());
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic]
    fn test_extract_code_from_markdown_exception() {
        let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
            extract_code_from_markdown(None::<&str> as Option<&str>);
        });
        assert!(result.is_err());
    }
}
```

### Notes
- The `extract_code_from_markdown` function has been simplified for demonstration purposes and does not actually extract code blocks from markdown.
- Error handling in Rust is more explicit and type-safe than in Python. The `should_panic` attribute is used to test that a function panics.
- Rust does not have direct equivalents to Python's dynamic typing and some of its built-in functions. Hence, adaptations are necessary.
- For real-world applications, consider using a crate like `pulldown-cmark` for parsing markdown and extracting code blocks.
- Always ensure compatibility with the rest of the project by using Rust's idiomatic structures and libraries.
