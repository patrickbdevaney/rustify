### Conversion Viability
The provided Python code can be partially converted to Rust, but due to the significant differences between the two languages, it's not possible to convert the entire codebase directly. Some parts, such as dynamic typing, decorators, and certain library-specific functionality (e.g., `unittest.mock` and `pydantic`), will require alternative implementations in Rust.

### Rust Equivalent
Below is a simplified Rust version of the provided Python code. Note that this example focuses on the core functionality and does not cover all the test cases and edge scenarios presented in the Python code.

```rust
// Define a trait for Tool
trait Tool {
    fn invoke(&self, input: &str) -> String;
    fn ainvoke(&self, input: &str) -> String;
}

// Define a struct for BaseTool
struct BaseTool {
    name: String,
    func: Box<dyn Fn(&str) -> String>,
}

impl BaseTool {
    fn new(name: String, func: Box<dyn Fn(&str) -> String>) -> Self {
        BaseTool { name, func }
    }
}

impl Tool for BaseTool {
    fn invoke(&self, input: &str) -> String {
        (self.func)(input)
    }

    fn ainvoke(&self, input: &str) -> String {
        (self.func)(input)
    }
}

// Define a struct for StructuredTool
struct StructuredTool {
    name: String,
    func: Box<dyn Fn(&str) -> String>,
    args_schema: String,
}

impl StructuredTool {
    fn new(name: String, func: Box<dyn Fn(&str) -> String>, args_schema: String) -> Self {
        StructuredTool {
            name,
            func,
            args_schema,
        }
    }
}

impl Tool for StructuredTool {
    fn invoke(&self, input: &str) -> String {
        (self.func)(input)
    }

    fn ainvoke(&self, input: &str) -> String {
        (self.func)(input)
    }
}

// Define a function to create a tool
fn tool<F>(name: String, func: F) -> Box<dyn Tool>
where
    F: Fn(&str) -> String + 'static,
{
    Box::new(BaseTool::new(name, Box::new(func)))
}

fn main() {
    // Example usage
    let tool = tool("test_tool".to_string(), |input| format!("Processed {}", input));
    println!("{}", tool.invoke("input_data"));
    println!("{}", tool.ainvoke("input_data"));
}
```

### Limitations and Challenges

*   **Dynamic Typing**: Rust is a statically typed language, which means it's not possible to directly replicate Python's dynamic typing. You'll need to use enums, traits, or other pattern matching techniques to handle different types.
*   **Decorators**: Rust does not have a direct equivalent to Python decorators. Instead, you can use higher-order functions, macros, or other design patterns to achieve similar functionality.
*   **Pydantic**: There is no direct equivalent to Pydantic in Rust. You can use libraries like `serde` or `derive_builder` to generate boilerplate code for serialization and deserialization, but you may need to create custom structs and implement traits manually.
*   **async/await**: Rust supports asynchronous programming using the `async/await` syntax, but the implementation is different from Python's. You'll need to use Rust's `async-std` or `tokio` libraries and follow their guidelines for writing asynchronous code.
*   **Error Handling**: Rust has a strong focus on error handling, and you'll need to use `Result`, `Option`, or custom error types to handle errors in your code. Python's `try/except` blocks are not directly applicable in Rust.

### Conclusion
Converting Python code to Rust requires a deep understanding of both languages and their ecosystems. While some parts of the code can be directly translated, others will require significant rework or alternative implementations. By understanding the limitations and challenges involved, you can create efficient and idiomatic Rust code that meets your needs.
