### Conversion Assessment:

The given Python file appears to be a set of unit tests for a concurrent workflow system, utilizing the `unittest.mock` library for mocking dependencies. While Rust has strong support for concurrent programming and unit testing, the direct conversion of these tests to Rust is viable, but with some limitations.

The primary challenges in converting these tests to Rust are:
- Rust does not natively support the same level of mocking as Python's `unittest.mock`. Instead, you would typically design your code with testability in mind, often using trait objects or interfaces for components that need to be mocked.
- The `concurrent.futures` library, including `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `Future`, has direct equivalents in Rust, such as the `tokio` or `async-std` crates for async programming, but the direct translation requires understanding Rust's async/await syntax and the ecosystem's differences.

### Rust Conversion:

We'll aim to maintain the original behavior while adapting to Rust's paradigms. Note that we'll use the `tokio` crate for async/await functionality and `mockall` for mocking, which requires adding `tokio` and `mockall` as dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`.

First, ensure your `Cargo.toml` includes the necessary dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
mockall = "0.11.1"
async-std = "1.11.0"
```

Now, let's convert the Python file to Rust. We'll define the necessary structs and traits first, followed by the test functions.

```rust
// Define a trait for Task to enable mocking
pub trait TaskTrait {
    fn execute(&self);
}

// Implement the trait for a simple Task struct
pub struct Task {
    agent: Box<dyn TaskTrait>,
}

impl Task {
    pub fn new(agent: Box<dyn TaskTrait>) -> Self {
        Task { agent }
    }

    pub fn execute(&self) {
        self.agent.execute();
    }
}

// Define a trait for Agent to enable mocking
pub trait AgentTrait: TaskTrait {
    // Additional agent methods if needed
}

// Implement the trait for a simple Agent struct
pub struct Agent;

impl TaskTrait for Agent {
    fn execute(&self) {
        // Agent execution logic
    }
}

impl AgentTrait for Agent {}

// ConcurrentWorkflow implementation
use tokio::task;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::sync::Mutex;

pub struct ConcurrentWorkflow {
    max_workers: usize,
    tasks: Arc<Mutex<Vec<Box<dyn TaskTrait>>>>,
}

impl ConcurrentWorkflow {
    pub fn new(max_workers: usize) -> Self {
        ConcurrentWorkflow {
            max_workers,
            tasks: Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new())),
        }
    }

    pub async fn add(&self, task: Box<dyn TaskTrait>) {
        self.tasks.lock().unwrap().push(task);
    }

    pub async fn run(&self) {
        let tasks = self.tasks.lock().unwrap().clone();
        let mut handles = Vec::new();
        for task in tasks {
            let handle = task::spawn(async move {
                task.execute();
            });
            handles.push(handle);
        }
        for handle in handles {
            handle.await.unwrap();
        }
    }

    fn _execute_task(&self, task: &Box<dyn TaskTrait>) {
        task.execute();
    }
}

// Tests using mockall
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use mockall::{automock, predicate::*};
    use tokio::test;

    #[automock]
    impl TaskTrait for Agent {}

    #[test]
    async fn test_add() {
        let mut workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow::new(2);
        let task: Box<dyn TaskTrait> = Box::new(Agent);
        workflow.add(task).await;
        assert!(workflow.tasks.lock().unwrap().len() > 0);
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_run() {
        let mut workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow::new(2);
        let task1: Box<dyn TaskTrait> = Box::new(Agent);
        let task2: Box<dyn TaskTrait> = Box::new(Agent);
        workflow.add(task1).await;
        workflow.add(task2).await;
        workflow.run().await;
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_execute_task() {
        let workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow::new(2);
        let task: Box<dyn TaskTrait> = Box::new(Agent);
        workflow._execute_task(&task);
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_agent_execution() {
        let workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow::new(2);
        let agent = Agent;
        let task = Task::new(Box::new(agent));
        workflow._execute_task(&task);
    }
}
```

### Limitations and Challenges:

1. **Mocking:** The mocking approach in Rust requires designing interfaces (traits) that can be implemented by mock objects. This might require adjustments in how your code is structured compared to Python.
2. **Async/Await:** Rust's async/await syntax and ecosystem (e.g., using `tokio`) are quite different from Python's `asyncio`. Understanding these differences is crucial for a successful conversion.
3. **Concurrency Model:** Rust's concurrency model, while powerful, has a different set of guarantees and pitfalls (e.g., ownership and borrowing) that need to be understood to use it effectively.
4. **Testing Frameworks:** While `mockall` provides a way to generate mock implementations of traits, the overall testing framework and ecosystem in Rust might feel different from what Python offers with `unittest.mock`.

### Conclusion:

While converting Python code to Rust is generally viable, doing so requires understanding the paradigms and ecosystems of both languages. The conversion of the provided Python file to Rust involves redesigning the code to fit Rust's async/await model, using traits for mocking, and leveraging Rust's strong type system and concurrency features. This conversion example should serve as a starting point, but it may need further adjustments based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
