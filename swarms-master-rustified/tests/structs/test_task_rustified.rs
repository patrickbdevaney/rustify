### Viability of Conversion to Rust

```rust
// Conversion viability: PARTIALLY VIABLE
// Reasoning: The majority of the provided Python tests seem to be focused on testing the functionality of the Agent and Task structs, 
//             which can be converted to Rust. However, the tests also rely heavily on mocking and patching, which is not directly 
//             supported in Rust. Additionally, some tests use Python-specific features like the datetime and timedelta modules, 
//             which would need to be replaced with Rust equivalents.
```

### Portion of the Code that Can be Converted

The following parts of the code can be converted to Rust:

1. The `Agent` and `Task` structs and their methods.
2. The test cases that test the basic functionality of the `Agent` and `Task` structs.

### Potential Challenges and Limitations

1. **Mocking and Patching**: Rust does not have direct support for mocking and patching like Python's `unittest.mock` module. 
   This functionality would need to be implemented manually or using a third-party library.
2. **Date and Time Handling**: Rust's `std::time` module provides basic date and time functionality, but it may not have all the features 
   of Python's `datetime` and `timedelta` modules.
3. **Error Handling**: Rust's error handling system is based on the concept of `Result` and `Option`, which may need to be used 
   instead of Python's try-except blocks.

### Example of Converted Code

Here is an example of how the `Agent` and `Task` structs and some of their methods could be implemented in Rust:

```rust
// Define the Agent struct
pub struct Agent {
    pub id: String,
    pub llm: GPT4VisionAPI,
}

impl Agent {
    pub fn new(id: String, llm: GPT4VisionAPI) -> Self {
        Agent { id, llm }
    }

    // Define the run method for the Agent struct
    pub fn run(&self, task: String, img: String) -> Result<String, String> {
        // Implement the run method logic here
        // For now, just return a dummy result
        Ok("Dummy result".to_string())
    }
}

// Define the Task struct
pub struct Task {
    pub id: String,
    pub task: String,
    pub agents: Vec<Agent>,
    pub dependencies: Vec<String>,
}

impl Task {
    pub fn new(id: String, task: String, agents: Vec<Agent>, dependencies: Vec<String>) -> Self {
        Task { id, task, agents, dependencies }
    }

    // Define the execute method for the Task struct
    pub fn execute(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>, String> {
        // Implement the execute method logic here
        // For now, just return a dummy result
        Ok(vec!["Dummy result 1".to_string(), "Dummy result 2".to_string()])
    }
}

// Define the GPT4VisionAPI struct
pub struct GPT4VisionAPI {}

impl GPT4VisionAPI {
    // Implement the GPT4VisionAPI methods here
}

// Example usage:
fn main() {
    let agent = Agent::new("Agent 1".to_string(), GPT4VisionAPI {});
    let task = Task::new("Task 1".to_string(), "Task description".to_string(), vec![agent], vec![]);
    let result = task.execute();
    match result {
        Ok(results) => println!("Task results: {:?}", results),
        Err(error) => println!("Error executing task: {}", error),
    }
}
```

### Testing the Code

To test the converted code, you can use Rust's built-in `#[cfg(test)]` attribute to define test functions. Here is an example of how you could test the `Agent` and `Task` structs:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_agent_run() {
        let agent = Agent::new("Agent 1".to_string(), GPT4VisionAPI {});
        let result = agent.run("Task description".to_string(), "Image".to_string());
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_task_execute() {
        let agent = Agent::new("Agent 1".to_string(), GPT4VisionAPI {});
        let task = Task::new("Task 1".to_string(), "Task description".to_string(), vec![agent], vec![]);
        let result = task.execute();
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
}
```
