// Conversion Viability: Most of the code can be converted to Rust, but there may be compatibility issues with the Python libraries used (e.g., swarms, swarm_models, pydantic).
// The reasoning behind this assessment is that Rust has a different set of libraries and frameworks compared to Python, and some of the Python libraries may not have Rust equivalents.
// The code that deals with the logic of the college selection workflow can be converted, but the external library dependencies will need to be replaced with Rust versions.

Potential limitations and challenges:
- **External library dependencies:** The code relies on Python libraries `swarms`, `swarm_models`, and `pydantic`. Rust equivalents would need to be found or implemented.
- **API requests:** The code makes API requests using `reqwest` in Rust. The API endpoint and request structure might need adjustments to match the original Python code.
- **Async/await:** The Rust code uses synchronous API requests. For a more efficient and scalable solution, you could use async/await with libraries like `tokio` or `async-std`.
- **Error handling:** The code does not include comprehensive error handling. In a production environment, you should add proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
- **Agent logic:** The agent logic is simplified in the Rust version. You might need to add more complex logic and conditional statements to match the original Python code.
- **Model initialization:** The model initialization is simplified in the Rust version. You might need to add more complex model initialization logic to match the original Python code.
