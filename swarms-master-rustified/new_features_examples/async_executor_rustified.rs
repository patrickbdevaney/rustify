### Conversion Assessment

The provided Python code utilizes asyncio for asynchronous operations, multiprocessing, and high-speed execution of functions. 
Converting this code to Rust is viable because Rust provides similar high-level abstractions for concurrency and parallelism. 
However, it might require more manual memory management and synchronization primitives compared to Python's asyncio.
Rust provides an excellent foundation with its ownership system and borrow checker, allowing for robust and safe concurrent programming.

### Limitations and Challenges

1. **Asyncio vs Tokio/Rayon**: Python's asyncio is primarily designed for I/O-bound operations, whereas Rust's async/await is more low-level, and libraries like Tokio or async-std are often used for similar purposes. For CPU-bound tasks, Rust's rayon crate can be utilized for parallel execution.
2. **Memory Management**: Rust requires manual memory management through smart pointers like Arc or Mutex, adding complexity compared to Python's garbage collection.
3. **Process Creation**: Creating multiple processes in Rust is more involved than in Python due to Rust's focus on memory safety, potentially involving cross-platform issues.

### Rust Equivalent

```rust
// Import necessary crates
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use rayon::prelude::*;
use std::time::Instant;
use std::collections::HashMap;

// Define the HighSpeedExecutor structure
pub struct HighSpeedExecutor {
    num_threads: usize,
}

impl HighSpeedExecutor {
    // Initialize the executor with a configurable number of threads
    pub fn new(num_threads: Option<usize>) -> Self {
        let num_threads = match num_threads {
            Some(n) => n,
            None => num_cpus::get(), // Use the number of CPU cores by default
        };

        HighSpeedExecutor { num_threads }
    }

    // Execute a function multiple times in parallel
    pub fn execute_batch<F, R>(&self, func: F, num_executions: usize) -> HashMap<String, f64>
    where
        F: Fn() -> R + Send + Sync + 'static,
        R: Send + 'static,
    {
        // Start timing
        let start_time = Instant::now();

        // Execute the function in parallel
        (0..num_executions).into_par_iter().for_each(|_| func());

        // Calculate the duration and execution rate
        let duration = start_time.elapsed().as_secs_f64();
        let executions_per_second = num_executions as f64 / duration;

        // Return the results
        let mut results = HashMap::new();
        results.insert("executions".to_string(), num_executions as f64);
        results.insert("duration".to_string(), duration);
        results.insert("executions_per_second".to_string(), executions_per_second);
        results
    }
}

// Define an example function to execute
fn example_function() -> i32 {
    let result = 42 * 42;
    println!("Result: {}", result);
    result
}

fn main() {
    // Create an executor with the number of CPU cores
    let executor = HighSpeedExecutor::new(None);

    // Execute the function 1000 times
    let result = executor.execute_batch(example_function, 1000);

    // Print the results
    println!("Completed {} executions in {:.2} seconds", result["executions"], result["duration"]);
    println!("Rate: {:.2} executions/second", result["executions_per_second"]);
}
```

Note: The above code uses the rayon crate for parallel execution and the tokio crate for async operations. You may need to add the following dependencies to your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
[dependencies]
num_cpus = "1.13.0"
rayon = "1.5.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```
