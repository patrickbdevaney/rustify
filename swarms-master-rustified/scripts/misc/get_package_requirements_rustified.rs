### Analysis and Conversion Assessment
#### Viability: 
Conversion is partially viable. The provided Python script utilizes the `pkg_resources` module to retrieve package versions, which is part of the `setuptools` library in Python. Rust does not have a direct equivalent for this functionality. However, we can use the `pip` command-line tool to achieve similar results.

#### Reasoning: 
The main challenge in converting this script to Rust is the lack of a built-in package manager like `pip` in Rust's standard library. However, we can leverage the `std::process::Command` module to execute `pip` commands and parse their output to extract package versions. This approach requires `pip` to be installed and available on the system.

### Rust Conversion
```rust
// Viable: Partially
// Reasoning: Utilizes std::process::Command for pip interactions, requires pip installation.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader, BufWriter, Write};
use std::process::Command;

/// Retrieves package versions from a requirements file and writes them to an output file.
fn get_package_versions(requirements_path: &str, output_path: &str) {
    // Read requirements file
    let file = match File::open(requirements_path) {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(_) => {
            println!("Error: The file '{}' was not found.", requirements_path);
            return;
        }
    };

    let reader = BufReader::new(file);
    let mut package_versions = Vec::new();

    for line in reader.lines() {
        let line = match line {
            Ok(line) => line,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        // Skip empty lines and comments
        if line.trim().is_empty() || line.trim().starts_with('#') {
            continue;
        }

        // Extract package name
        let package_name = line.split("==").next().unwrap().trim();

        // Use pip to get package version
        let output = Command::new("pip")
            .arg("show")
            .arg(package_name)
            .output()
            .expect("Failed to execute pip command");

        if output.status.success() {
            let version = String::from_utf8(output.stdout).unwrap();
            let version = version.lines().find_map(|line| {
                if line.starts_with("Version: ") {
                    Some(line.trim_start_matches("Version: ").trim())
                } else {
                    None
                }
            });

            if let Some(version) = version {
                package_versions.push(format!("{}=={}", package_name, version));
            } else {
                package_versions.push(format!("{}: not installed", package_name));
            }
        } else {
            package_versions.push(format!("{}: not installed", package_name));
        }
    }

    // Write package versions to output file
    let file = match File::create(output_path) {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(_) => {
            println!("Error: Unable to create file '{}'", output_path);
            return;
        }
    };

    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(file);
    for package_version in package_versions {
        writeln!(writer, "{}", package_version).expect("Failed to write to output file");
    }

    println!("Versions written to {}", output_path);
}

fn main() {
    get_package_versions("requirements.txt", "installed_versions.txt");
}
```

### Limitations and Challenges:
1. **Dependency on `pip`:** The Rust conversion relies on the `pip` command-line tool being installed and available on the system. This might not be the case in all environments, especially in isolated or cross-compilation scenarios.
2. **Process Execution:** Using `std::process::Command` to execute `pip` commands introduces potential security risks if the input (package names) is not properly sanitized. In this example, we assume the input is safe.
3. **Output Parsing:** The conversion parses the output of `pip show` to extract the package version. This parsing is simplistic and may break if the output format of `pip show` changes in future versions.
4. **Error Handling:** While basic error handling is implemented, more comprehensive error handling (e.g., distinguishing between different types of errors from `pip` commands) could further enhance the robustness of the conversion.

### Recommendations:
- Ensure `pip` is installed and accessible in the target environment.
- Consider implementing more sophisticated error handling and output parsing to make the conversion more robust.
- Evaluate the feasibility of using Rust's package manager, Cargo, for similar tasks if applicable, to avoid external command execution.
