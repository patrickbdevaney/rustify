### Viability of Conversion:
The conversion of the provided Python file to Rust is viable. The file utilizes standard library functions for file operations and directory traversal, which have equivalents in Rust. However, the conversion may require adjustments to handle errors and exceptions, as Rust's approach to error handling differs from Python's.

### Risks and Limitations:
1. **Error Handling**: Rust requires explicit error handling using `Result` or `Option` types, whereas Python uses try-except blocks. This will lead to changes in the code structure.
2. **Path Manipulation**: Rust's `Path` and `PathBuf` types provide methods for path manipulation, which might require adjustments to achieve the same functionality as the Python code.
3. **File Operations**: Rust provides the `std::fs` module for file operations, which has equivalent functions to Python's `os` module.

### Rust Equivalent:
```rust
// Conversion assessment: Viable.
// The Python file can be converted to Rust with modifications to error handling and path manipulation.
use std::fs;
use std::io::{BufWriter, Write};
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

/// Generate a list of files in a directory in the specified format and write it to a file.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `directory` - The directory to list the files from.
/// * `output_file` - The file to write the output to.
fn generate_file_list(directory: &str, output_file: &str) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Open the output file for writing
    let file = fs::File::create(output_file)?;
    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(file);

    // Traverse the directory and its subdirectories
    let directory_path = Path::new(directory);
    traverse_directory(directory_path, &mut writer)?;

    Ok(())
}

/// Traverse the directory and its subdirectories, writing file paths to the output file.
fn traverse_directory(directory: &Path, writer: &mut BufWriter<std::fs::File>) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Iterate over the directory entries
    for entry in fs::read_dir(directory)? {
        let entry = entry?;
        let path = entry.path();

        // Check if the entry is a directory
        if path.is_dir() {
            // Recursively traverse the subdirectory
            traverse_directory(&path, writer)?;
        } else if path.is_file() {
            // Check if the file has the .md extension
            if path.extension().map_or(false, |ext| ext == "md") {
                // Remove the directory from the file path and replace slashes with dots
                let relative_path = path.strip_prefix(directory).unwrap();
                let file_path = relative_path.to_str().unwrap().replace("/", ".");

                // Remove the file extension
                let file_name = path.file_stem().unwrap().to_str().unwrap();

                // Write the file name and path to the output file
                writeln!(writer, "- {}: \"swarms/utils/{}\"", file_name, file_path)?;
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Use the function to generate the file list
    generate_file_list("docs/swarms/structs", "file_list.txt")?;

    Ok(())
}
```
In the Rust version, I have made the following changes:
*   Used `std::fs` module for file operations.
*   Utilized `Path` and `PathBuf` for path manipulation.
*   Implemented error handling using `std::io::Result`.
*   Used `BufWriter` for efficient writing to the output file.
*   Applied the `traverse_directory` function to recursively traverse the directory and its subdirectories.
*   Implemented the `strip_prefix` method to remove the directory from the file path.
*   Used `file_stem` and `to_str` to remove the file extension and get the file name.

Note: You may need to handle errors according to your project's requirements, as the code above simply returns the error using `?`.
